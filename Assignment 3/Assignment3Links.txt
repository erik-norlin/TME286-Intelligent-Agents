Assignment 3.1
======================================================
When writing code, use the solution in StartingPoint3 (available on the
Canvas page for the assignment).

Use the movie-dialog corpus from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/movie-dialog-corpus

Note: To obtain data from Kaggle, you have to register. It's free.

Assignment 3.2
======================================================
ChatGPT access:

(Requires free registration).

Examples (there are many others) of ChatGPT failures:

Winograd schemas (optional to use - just a suggestion to give you
an initial direction...)

Link to a Python implementation of DNN-based chatbot

https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/chatbot_tutorial.ipynb

You will need the Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus, but you'll need a different version than
the one list under Assignment 3.1 - The Python implementation used here (3.4)
requires that the fields should be separated by the character string " +++$+++ ".
You can find the corresponding data set here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajathmc/cornell-moviedialog-corpus

(Of course, one could instead have modified the Python script in the Colab notebook, but here
we instead choose the option of downloading the data from the site just mentioned).

From this data set, you need to download the files "movie_lines.txt" and "movie_conversations.txt",
and place them in a folder called data/cornell movie-dialogs corpus/ in your Colab account.
To do that, click on the folder icon on the left side of the Colab page. Then you
can add the necessary folders and finally drag-and-drop the two text files.

Note: There is a bit of a problem with the initial data processing. 
For some reason, Python is unable to load the lines (from movie_lines.txt)
with IDs 444102 and 504983, so you need to remove those lines, and also
remove the use of those IDs from movie_conversations.txt.

The chatbot has an annoying feature, namely that it says "Error: Encountered unknown word"
if any word in the input sentence is not in the vocabulary. Please change the
Python code so that it instead just ignores such words in the input sentence.
