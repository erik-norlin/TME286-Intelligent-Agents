CONTINUED 	 How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED 	 I'm sorry Dr. Smyslov but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED 	 We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in please. 	 Right. Just a sec.
Right. Just a sec. 	 Okay. 
Okay.  	 Okay come on down.
Dave if you've a minute I'd like your advice on something. 	 Sure what is it?
Sure what is it? 	 Well it's nothing really important but it's annoying.
Well it's nothing really important but it's annoying. 	 What's up?
What's up? 	 It's about my salary cheques.
It's about my salary cheques. 	 Yes?
Yes? 	 Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it because I've got the same problem. 	 Really.
Really. 	 Yes.
It's possible. 	 Well what do you think we ought to do about it?
Well what do you think we ought to do about it? 	 I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out. 	 I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training. 	 No. I never did either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training. 	 I suppose so. Though of course there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose so. Though of course there's a more sinister explanation. 	 Oh?
Oh? 	 Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out. 	 No as a matter of fact I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told. 	 That seems very unlikely.
That seems very unlikely. 	 Yes I thought so.
Yes I thought so. 	 Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now. 	 How?
How? 	 Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us but they'd never keep anything from Hal. 	 That's true.
Yes but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us. 	 I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable. 	 But not completely inconceivable?
But not completely inconceivable? 	 I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible. 	 I guess it isn't.
I guess it isn't. 	 Still all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well that's something. 	 Yes I don't know what to make of it.
Yes I don't know what to make of it. 	 I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong. 	 Yes but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low. 	 Anyway it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going? 	 Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake? 	 Oh I'm fine I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh I'm fine I'm wide awake. What's up? 	 Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again. 	 You're kidding.
You're kidding. 	 No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure. 	 Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have? 	 Two more.
Two more. 	 Well I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal? 	 Yes.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them. 	 I guess you don't know your own strength old boy.
I guess you don't know your own strength old boy. 	 I guess not.
I guess not. 	 I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off. 	 Roger.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities Dave but I think we've got a problem. 	 What is it Hal?
What is it Hal? 	 MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours. 	 I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please let me have the hard copy.
Not now Hal I'd like to talk to you about something. 	 Sure Dave what's up?
Sure Dave what's up? 	 You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition? 	 Yes I know.
Yes I know. 	 You probably also know that we found them okay.
You probably also know that we found them okay. 	 Yes I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word Dave but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong. 	 Hal is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding Hal. 	 Well don't worry about it.
Well don't worry about it. 	 And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it. 	 Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored? 	 Yes it is Hal.
Yes it is Hal. 	 Well that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank isn't it? 	 Yes it is.
Yes it is. 	 I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
The antenna has to be replaced. 	 Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm goin to do this myself Hal. Let me have the control please. 	 Look Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Look Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me. 	 Hal switch to manual hibernation control.
CONTINUED 	 Yes I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED 	 Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED 	 Well what is it?
CONINUED 	 Well... it's silly but... if you want to why don't you?
CONTINUED 	 Still you really don't believe it do you?

Thank you. 	 Well how's it going back there?
Well I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic. 	 I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. 	 Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty. 	 I'll bet it's a fortune.
And your charming little daughter? 	 Oh she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact she's six tomorrow.
Oh she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact she's six tomorrow. 	 Oh that's such a delightful age.

He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days. 	 Well where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal. 	 Well that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink? 	 No thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
No thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going. 	 Well I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
