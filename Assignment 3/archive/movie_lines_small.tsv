L1045	u0	m0	BIANCA	They do not!
L1044	u2	m0	CAMERON	They do to!
L985	u0	m0	BIANCA	I hope so.
L984	u2	m0	CAMERON	She okay?
L925	u0	m0	BIANCA	Let's go.
L924	u2	m0	CAMERON	Wow
L872	u0	m0	BIANCA	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
L871	u2	m0	CAMERON	No
"L870	u0	m0	BIANCA	I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"
L869	u0	m0	BIANCA	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"L868	u2	m0	CAMERON	The ""real you""."
L867	u0	m0	BIANCA	What good stuff?
L866	u2	m0	CAMERON	I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
L865	u2	m0	CAMERON	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
L864	u0	m0	BIANCA	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like boring myself.
L863	u2	m0	CAMERON	What crap?
L862	u0	m0	BIANCA	do you listen to this crap?
L861	u2	m0	CAMERON	No...
"L860	u0	m0	BIANCA	Then Guillermo says ""If you go any lighter you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""
L699	u2	m0	CAMERON	You always been this selfish?
L698	u0	m0	BIANCA	But
L697	u2	m0	CAMERON	Then that's all you had to say.
L696	u0	m0	BIANCA	Well no...
L695	u2	m0	CAMERON	You never wanted to go out with 'me did you?
L694	u0	m0	BIANCA	I was?
"L693	u2	m0	CAMERON	I looked for you back at the party but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."
L663	u0	m0	BIANCA	Tons
L662	u2	m0	CAMERON	Have fun tonight?
L578	u2	m0	CAMERON	I believe we share an art instructor
L577	u0	m0	BIANCA	You know Chastity?
L576	u2	m0	CAMERON	Looks like things worked out tonight huh?
L575	u0	m0	BIANCA	Hi.
L407	u0	m0	BIANCA	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
L406	u2	m0	CAMERON	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
L405	u0	m0	BIANCA	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
L404	u2	m0	CAMERON	She's not a...
L403	u2	m0	CAMERON	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
L402	u0	m0	BIANCA	I really really really wanna go but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
L401	u2	m0	CAMERON	Sure have.
L368	u0	m0	BIANCA	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
L367	u2	m0	CAMERON	How do you get your hair to look like that?
L366	u0	m0	BIANCA	You're sweet.
L365	u2	m0	CAMERON	You have my word.  As a gentleman
L364	u0	m0	BIANCA	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
L363	u2	m0	CAMERON	You got something on your mind?
L281	u0	m0	BIANCA	Where?
L280	u2	m0	CAMERON	There.
L277	u2	m0	CAMERON	Well there's someone I think might be --
L276	u0	m0	BIANCA	How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
L275	u0	m0	BIANCA	Forget French.
L274	u2	m0	CAMERON	That's because it's such a nice one.
L273	u0	m0	BIANCA	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
L272	u2	m0	CAMERON	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
L271	u0	m0	BIANCA	C'esc ma tete. This is my head
L208	u2	m0	CAMERON	Let me see what I can do.
L207	u0	m0	BIANCA	Gosh if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
L206	u2	m0	CAMERON	That's a shame.
L205	u0	m0	BIANCA	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
L204	u2	m0	CAMERON	Why?
L203	u2	m0	CAMERON	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
L202	u0	m0	BIANCA	The thing is Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
L201	u2	m0	CAMERON	Cameron.
L200	u0	m0	BIANCA	No no it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
L199	u2	m0	CAMERON	Forget it.
L198	u0	m0	BIANCA	You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
L197	u2	m0	CAMERON	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
L196	u0	m0	BIANCA	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
L195	u2	m0	CAMERON	Well I thought we'd start with pronunciation if that's okay with you.
L194	u0	m0	BIANCA	Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
L953	u0	m0	BIANCA	I did.
L952	u3	m0	CHASTITY	You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
L660	u3	m0	CHASTITY	I don't have to be home 'til two.
L659	u0	m0	BIANCA	I have to be home in twenty minutes.
L600	u3	m0	CHASTITY	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
L599	u0	m0	BIANCA	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know?
L598	u3	m0	CHASTITY	Bianca I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
L597	u0	m0	BIANCA	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
L596	u3	m0	CHASTITY	Is he oily or dry?
L595	u0	m0	BIANCA	He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
L580	u0	m0	BIANCA	Would you mind getting me a drink Cameron?
L579	u3	m0	CHASTITY	Great
L573	u0	m0	BIANCA	Joey.
L572	u3	m0	CHASTITY	Who?
L571	u0	m0	BIANCA	Where did he go?  He was just here.
L51	u0	m0	BIANCA	You might wanna think about it
L50	u3	m0	CHASTITY	No.
L49	u0	m0	BIANCA	Did you change your hair?
L760	u0	m0	BIANCA	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
L759	u4	m0	JOEY	Listen I want to talk to you about the prom.
L758	u4	m0	JOEY	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
L757	u0	m0	BIANCA	Hi Joey.
L756	u4	m0	JOEY	Hey sweet cheeks.
L593	u4	m0	JOEY	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
L592	u0	m0	BIANCA	Neat...
L591	u4	m0	JOEY	It's a gay cruise line but I'll be like wearing a uniform and stuff.
L590	u0	m0	BIANCA	Queen Harry?
"L589	u4	m0	JOEY	So yeah I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."
L397	u0	m0	BIANCA	Hopefully.
L396	u4	m0	JOEY	Exactly  So you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
L395	u0	m0	BIANCA	Expensive?
L394	u4	m0	JOEY	It's more
L1052	u5	m0	KAT	Perm?
L1051	u0	m0	BIANCA	Patrick -- is that- a.
L1022	u5	m0	KAT	It's just you.
L1021	u0	m0	BIANCA	Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
L1011	u0	m0	BIANCA	No! I just wanted
L1010	u5	m0	KAT	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
L1009	u0	m0	BIANCA	I just wanted --
L1008	u5	m0	KAT	You set me up.
L1007	u0	m0	BIANCA	Let go!
L983	u5	m0	KAT	So did you
L982	u0	m0	BIANCA	You looked beautiful last night you know.
L914	u0	m0	BIANCA	I guess I'll never know will I?
L913	u5	m0	KAT	Not all experiences are good Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
L912	u0	m0	BIANCA	God you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark so I can't experience anything for myself
L911	u5	m0	KAT	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
L910	u0	m0	BIANCA	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
L909	u5	m0	KAT	That's not
L908	u0	m0	BIANCA	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
L907	u5	m0	KAT	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
L906	u0	m0	BIANCA	Why didn't you tell me?
"L905	u5	m0	KAT	After that I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
L904	u0	m0	BIANCA	But
L903	u5	m0	KAT	Just once.  Afterwards I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
L902	u0	m0	BIANCA	You did what?
L901	u5	m0	KAT	He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
L900	u0	m0	BIANCA	As in...
L899	u5	m0	KAT	Now I do.  Back then was a different story.
L898	u0	m0	BIANCA	But you hate Joey
L897	u5	m0	KAT	He was like a total babe
L896	u0	m0	BIANCA	Why?
L895	u5	m0	KAT	In 9th.  For a month
L894	u0	m0	BIANCA	What?
L893	u5	m0	KAT	Joey never told you we went out did he?
L892	u0	m0	BIANCA	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go because you won ' t.
L891	u5	m0	KAT	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s .
L890	u0	m0	BIANCA	Like you care.
L889	u5	m0	KAT	Listen I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
L656	u5	m0	KAT	You're welcome.
L655	u0	m0	BIANCA	I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
L602	u0	m0	BIANCA	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
L601	u5	m0	KAT	Bianca I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
L543	u5	m0	KAT	Can we go now?
L542	u0	m0	BIANCA	You are so completely unbalanced.
L533	u0	m0	BIANCA	Yeah he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out I should obsess over a dead guy too.
L532	u5	m0	KAT	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
L531	u0	m0	BIANCA	Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
L530	u5	m0	KAT	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
L529	u0	m0	BIANCA	Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
L527	u0	m0	BIANCA	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
L526	u5	m0	KAT	What's normal?
L525	u0	m0	BIANCA	You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal I can't be normal.
L445	u0	m0	BIANCA	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
L444	u5	m0	KAT	What do you think?
L443	u0	m0	BIANCA	Oh I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
L442	u5	m0	KAT	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
L441	u0	m0	BIANCA	Oh my God does this mean you're becoming normal?
L320	u0	m0	BIANCA	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
L319	u5	m0	KAT	I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
L165	u0	m0	BIANCA	Nowhere... Hi Daddy.
L164	u5	m0	KAT	Where've you been?
L923	u0	m0	BIANCA	I have a date Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
L922	u11	m0	WALTER	I'm missing something.
L884	u0	m0	BIANCA	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
L883	u11	m0	WALTER	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
"L882	u0	m0	BIANCA	He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
L881	u11	m0	WALTER	It's that hot rod Joey right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
L880	u0	m0	BIANCA	No but
L879	u11	m0	WALTER	The prom?  Kat has a date?
L878	u0	m0	BIANCA	Daddy I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
L546	u11	m0	WALTER	Because she'll scare them away.
L545	u0	m0	BIANCA	Why?
L544	u11	m0	WALTER	Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
L540	u11	m0	WALTER	Just for a minute
L539	u0	m0	BIANCA	Daddy no!
L538	u11	m0	WALTER	Wear the belly before you go.
L537	u0	m0	BIANCA	It's just a party. Daddy.
L536	u11	m0	WALTER	Oh God.  It's starting.
L524	u11	m0	WALTER	If Kat's not going you're not going.
L523	u0	m0	BIANCA	Daddy people expect me to be there!
"L521	u0	m0	BIANCA	It's just a party. Daddy but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
L520	u11	m0	WALTER	Otherwise known as an orgy?
L519	u0	m0	BIANCA	If you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
L518	u11	m0	WALTER	And where're you going?
L517	u0	m0	BIANCA	Daddy I --
L190	u11	m0	WALTER	Exactly my point
L189	u0	m0	BIANCA	But she doesn't want to date.
L183	u0	m0	BIANCA	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant Daddy!
L182	u11	m0	WALTER	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
L181	u0	m0	BIANCA	What if she never starts dating?
L180	u11	m0	WALTER	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
L179	u0	m0	BIANCA	Now don't get upset. Daddy but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
L463	u1	m0	BRUCE	Just sent 'em through.
L462	u9	m0	PATRICK	Padua girls.  One tall decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
L461	u1	m0	BRUCE	Never
L460	u9	m0	PATRICK	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
L459	u1	m0	BRUCE	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
L458	u9	m0	PATRICK	Always a pleasure Brucie.
L779	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Best case scenario you're back on the payroll for awhile.
L778	u2	m0	CAMERON	You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
L586	u2	m0	CAMERON	No I ' m not.
L585	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Buttholus extremus.  But hey you're making progress.
L584	u2	m0	CAMERON	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
L583	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
L500	u2	m0	CAMERON	Hell I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
L499	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You told me that part already.
L433	u2	m0	CAMERON	It's her favorite band.
L432	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Assail your ears for one night.
L425	u2	m0	CAMERON	Okay!  I wasn't sure
L424	u7	m0	MICHAEL	He's pretty!
L419	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Dead at forty-one.
L418	u2	m0	CAMERON	Her favorite uncle
L417	u7	m0	MICHAEL	It's a lung cancer issue
L416	u2	m0	CAMERON	Number one.  She hates smokers
L391	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
L390	u2	m0	CAMERON	Will Bogey get bent?
L389	u7	m0	MICHAEL	In that case we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
L388	u2	m0	CAMERON	This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
L245	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots and while he's busy setting up the plan you have time to woo Bianca.
L244	u2	m0	CAMERON	You got him involved?
L225	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
L224	u2	m0	CAMERON	I thought you hated those people.
L223	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You know if you do go out with Bianca you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
L222	u2	m0	CAMERON	That's what I just said
L221	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
L220	u2	m0	CAMERON	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
L219	u7	m0	MICHAEL	I'm serious man he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
L218	u2	m0	CAMERON	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
L217	u7	m0	MICHAEL	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
L216	u2	m0	CAMERON	He seems like he thrives on danger
L215	u7	m0	MICHAEL	What makes you think he'll do it?
L213	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You wanna go out with him?
L212	u2	m0	CAMERON	What about him?
L211	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Unlikely but even so she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
L210	u2	m0	CAMERON	I teach her French get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
L159	u7	m0	MICHAEL	The mewling rampalian wretch herself.
L158	u2	m0	CAMERON	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
L157	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew.
L147	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You could consecrate with her my friend.
L146	u2	m0	CAMERON	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
L145	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
L144	u2	m0	CAMERON	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
L143	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You know French?
L142	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
L141	u2	m0	CAMERON	He always have that shit-eating grin?
L140	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
L139	u2	m0	CAMERON	Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
L92	u7	m0	MICHAEL	I could start with your haircut but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
L91	u2	m0	CAMERON	Why not?
L90	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
L89	u2	m0	CAMERON	Who is she?
L88	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You burn you pine you perish?
L87	u2	m0	CAMERON	That girl -- I --
L78	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Yeah but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
L77	u2	m0	CAMERON	That I'm used to.
L74	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Couple thousand. Most of them evil
L73	u2	m0	CAMERON	How many people go here?
L72	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Get out!
L71	u2	m0	CAMERON	Thirty-two.
L70	u7	m0	MICHAEL	How many people were in your old school?
L69	u2	m0	CAMERON	Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows though.
L68	u7	m0	MICHAEL	I was kidding. People actually live there?
L67	u2	m0	CAMERON	North actually.  How'd you   ?
L66	u7	m0	MICHAEL	So -- which Dakota you from?
L65	u7	m0	MICHAEL	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
L64	u2	m0	CAMERON	So they tell me...
L63	u7	m0	MICHAEL	You the new guy?
L781	u2	m0	CAMERON	You get the girl.
L780	u9	m0	PATRICK	What's the worst?
L745	u9	m0	PATRICK	Where?
L744	u2	m0	CAMERON	She kissed me.
L743	u9	m0	PATRICK	You makin' any headway?
L741	u9	m0	PATRICK	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
L740	u2	m0	CAMERON	She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
L726	u9	m0	PATRICK	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
L725	u2	m0	CAMERON	What'd you do to her?
L625	u9	m0	PATRICK	Then go get her
L624	u2	m0	CAMERON	Sure
L623	u9	m0	PATRICK	Cameron -- do you like the girl?
L622	u2	m0	CAMERON	She's partial to Joey not me
L621	u9	m0	PATRICK	What 're you talking about?
L620	u2	m0	CAMERON	It's off. The whole thing.
L619	u9	m0	PATRICK	Cameron I'm a little busy
L431	u9	m0	PATRICK	Don't make me do it man
L430	u2	m0	CAMERON	Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
L427	u9	m0	PATRICK	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
"L426	u2	m0	CAMERON	Okay -- Likes:  Thai food feminist prose and ""angry stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."
L412	u2	m0	CAMERON	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
L411	u9	m0	PATRICK	What've you got for me?
L386	u9	m0	PATRICK	Yeah -- we'll see.
L385	u2	m0	CAMERON	And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
L558	u4	m0	JOEY	And why would I do that?
L557	u5	m0	KAT	Leave my sister alone.
L556	u4	m0	JOEY	Your sister here?
L555	u5	m0	KAT	Away.
L554	u4	m0	JOEY	Where ya goin?
L336	u4	m0	JOEY	Not at all
L335	u5	m0	KAT	Hey -- do you mind?
L150	u4	m0	JOEY	They're running the rest of me next month.
L149	u5	m0	KAT	Yeah and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
L148	u4	m0	JOEY	The vintage look is over Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
L748	u4	m0	JOEY	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
L747	u9	m0	PATRICK	I don't know Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
L609	u4	m0	JOEY	Get her to act like a human
L608	u9	m0	PATRICK	Do what?
L607	u4	m0	JOEY	How'd you do it?
L606	u4	m0	JOEY	A deal's a deal.
L605	u9	m0	PATRICK	It's about time.
L358	u9	m0	PATRICK	Forget her sister then.
L357	u4	m0	JOEY	Forget it.
L356	u9	m0	PATRICK	A hundred bucks a date.
L355	u4	m0	JOEY	What?
L354	u9	m0	PATRICK	I just upped my price
L352	u9	m0	PATRICK	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
L351	u4	m0	JOEY	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
L350	u9	m0	PATRICK	I'm on it
L349	u4	m0	JOEY	When I shell out fifty I expect results.
L301	u9	m0	PATRICK	Fifty and you've got your man.
L300	u4	m0	JOEY	Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
L299	u4	m0	JOEY	Fine thirty.
L298	u9	m0	PATRICK	I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
L297	u9	m0	PATRICK	How much?
L296	u4	m0	JOEY	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
L295	u9	m0	PATRICK	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
L294	u4	m0	JOEY	You got it Verona.  I pick up the tab you do the honors.
L292	u4	m0	JOEY	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
L291	u9	m0	PATRICK	You need money to take a girl out
L290	u4	m0	JOEY	You just said
L289	u9	m0	PATRICK	Sure Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
L288	u4	m0	JOEY	Yeah whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
L287	u9	m0	PATRICK	Two legs nice rack...
L286	u4	m0	JOEY	What do you think?
L285	u9	m0	PATRICK	Yeah
L509	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
L508	u4	m0	JOEY	You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
L505	u7	m0	MICHAEL	What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
L504	u4	m0	JOEY	You and Verona?
L503	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Uh  yeah.  We're old friend*
L502	u4	m0	JOEY	I hear you're helpin' Verona.
L240	u7	m0	MICHAEL	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
L239	u4	m0	JOEY	Does this conversation have a purpose?
L238	u7	m0	MICHAEL	But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
L236	u4	m0	JOEY	We're not.
L235	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Well actually I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know just to see if you're interested.
L234	u4	m0	JOEY	We don't chat.
L233	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Nope - just came by to chat
L232	u4	m0	JOEY	Are you lost?
L231	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Hey.
L949	u5	m0	KAT	Oh honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
L948	u6	m0	MANDELLA	William - he asked me to meet him here.
L947	u5	m0	KAT	Who?
L946	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Have you seen him?
L755	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Oh good.  Something new and different for us.
L754	u5	m0	KAT	You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
L753	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Okay okay we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
L752	u5	m0	KAT	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
L751	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Well I guess we're not since we don't have dates .
L750	u5	m0	KAT	Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
L721	u5	m0	KAT	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
L720	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You didn't
L719	u5	m0	KAT	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
L718	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
L717	u5	m0	KAT	I didn't have a choice.
L716	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
L491	u5	m0	KAT	Who cares?
L490	u6	m0	MANDELLA	What'd he say?
L448	u5	m0	KAT	No fear.
L447	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You think this'll work?
"L254	u5	m0	KAT	If I was Bianca it would be ""Any school you want precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
L253	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Does it matter?
L252	u5	m0	KAT	I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
L251	u5	m0	KAT	Neither has his heterosexuality.
L250	u6	m0	MANDELLA	That's never been proven
L249	u5	m0	KAT	William didn't even go to high school
L248	u6	m0	MANDELLA	William would never have gone to a state school.
L247	u5	m0	KAT	So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
L152	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
L151	u5	m0	KAT	The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
L134	u6	m0	MANDELLA	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
L133	u5	m0	KAT	I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
L132	u6	m0	MANDELLA	An attempted slit.
L131	u5	m0	KAT	What's this?
L130	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Just a little.
L129	u5	m0	KAT	Mandella eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
L128	u5	m0	KAT	Block E?
L127	u6	m0	MANDELLA	He always look so
L126	u5	m0	KAT	I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
L125	u6	m0	MANDELLA	That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
L124	u5	m0	KAT	Patrick Verona   Random skid.
L123	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Who's that?
L1043	u9	m0	PATRICK	Don ' t you even dare. . .
L1042	u5	m0	KAT	Oh Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
L1041	u9	m0	PATRICK	Because I like to torture you.
L1040	u5	m0	KAT	Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
L1035	u9	m0	PATRICK	Yeah but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
L1034	u5	m0	KAT	Is that right?
L1033	u9	m0	PATRICK	Besides I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
L1032	u9	m0	PATRICK	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
L1031	u5	m0	KAT	A Fender Strat. You bought this?
L977	u9	m0	PATRICK	I didn't care about the money.
L976	u5	m0	KAT	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me?
L975	u9	m0	PATRICK	It wasn't like that.
L974	u5	m0	KAT	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
L973	u9	m0	PATRICK	Wait I...
L961	u9	m0	PATRICK	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
L960	u5	m0	KAT	That ' s completely adorable!
L959	u9	m0	PATRICK	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail I don't know Marilyn Manson and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
L958	u5	m0	KAT	What?
L957	u9	m0	PATRICK	My grandmother's .
L940	u5	m0	KAT	Look I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
L939	u9	m0	PATRICK	Oh huh
L938	u5	m0	KAT	It's just something I had.  You know
L937	u9	m0	PATRICK	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
L936	u5	m0	KAT	How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
L857	u9	m0	PATRICK	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
L856	u5	m0	KAT	Answer the question Patrick
L855	u9	m0	PATRICK	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
L854	u5	m0	KAT	You tell me.
L853	u9	m0	PATRICK	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
L852	u5	m0	KAT	Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
L848	u5	m0	KAT	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
L847	u9	m0	PATRICK	Why not?
L846	u5	m0	KAT	No I won't go with you
L845	u9	m0	PATRICK	No what?
L844	u5	m0	KAT	No.
L843	u9	m0	PATRICK	You know what I mean
L842	u5	m0	KAT	Is that a request or a command?
L841	u9	m0	PATRICK	Go to the prom with me
L840	u5	m0	KAT	You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
L839	u9	m0	PATRICK	No one else knows
L838	u5	m0	KAT	What?
L837	u9	m0	PATRICK	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
L836	u5	m0	KAT	No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
L835	u9	m0	PATRICK	I hate peas.
L834	u5	m0	KAT	Tell me something true.
L832	u5	m0	KAT	I know the porn career's a lie.
L831	u9	m0	PATRICK	Hearsay.
L830	u5	m0	KAT	The duck?
L829	u9	m0	PATRICK	Fallacy.
L828	u5	m0	KAT	State trooper?
L825	u5	m0	KAT	For. . . ?
L824	u9	m0	PATRICK	You up for it?
L823	u9	m0	PATRICK	You never disappointed me.
L822	u5	m0	KAT	How?
L821	u9	m0	PATRICK	Then you screwed up
L820	u5	m0	KAT	Something like that
L819	u9	m0	PATRICK	So if you disappoint them from the start you're covered?
L818	u5	m0	KAT	I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
L817	u9	m0	PATRICK	Yes
L816	u5	m0	KAT	Acting the way we do.
L815	u9	m0	PATRICK	So what's your excuse?
L814	u5	m0	KAT	Yeah well don't let it get out
L813	u9	m0	PATRICK	A soft side? Who knew?
L812	u5	m0	KAT	I dazzled him with my wit
L811	u9	m0	PATRICK	So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
L810	u5	m0	KAT	Good call.
L809	u9	m0	PATRICK	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
L808	u5	m0	KAT	The Partridge Family?
L806	u9	m0	PATRICK	Maybe.
L805	u5	m0	KAT	You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
L804	u9	m0	PATRICK	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
L803	u5	m0	KAT	Put your right foot there --
L802	u9	m0	PATRICK	Try lookin' at it from this angle
L801	u5	m0	KAT	C'mon.  It's not that bad
L800	u9	m0	PATRICK	I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
L799	u9	m0	PATRICK	Look up sunshine
L798	u5	m0	KAT	He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
L774	u5	m0	KAT	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
L773	u9	m0	PATRICK	So what did I have an effect on ?
L772	u5	m0	KAT	Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
L771	u9	m0	PATRICK	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
L770	u5	m0	KAT	Unwelcome.
L769	u9	m0	PATRICK	Wholesome.
L768	u9	m0	PATRICK	Pleasant?
L767	u5	m0	KAT	You 're so --
L766	u9	m0	PATRICK	I heard there was a poetry reading.
L765	u5	m0	KAT	What are you doing here?
L764	u9	m0	PATRICK	Excuse me have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
L690	u9	m0	PATRICK	No offense but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all but ...
L689	u5	m0	KAT	BIANCA
L688	u9	m0	PATRICK	Who?
L687	u5	m0	KAT	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
L686	u9	m0	PATRICK	So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
L684	u9	m0	PATRICK	I'm gettin' there
L683	u5	m0	KAT	Oh so now you think you know me?
L682	u9	m0	PATRICK	You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
L681	u5	m0	KAT	My father wouldn't approve of that that
L680	u9	m0	PATRICK	Start a band?
L679	u5	m0	KAT	This.
L678	u9	m0	PATRICK	Do what?
L677	u5	m0	KAT	I should do this.
L676	u5	m0	KAT	Why'd you lie?
L675	u9	m0	PATRICK	Then why'd you ask?
L674	u5	m0	KAT	No you weren't
L673	u9	m0	PATRICK	Maybe.
L672	u5	m0	KAT	Were you in jail?
L671	u9	m0	PATRICK	Busy
L670	u5	m0	KAT	When you were gone last year -- where were you?
L669	u5	m0	KAT	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
L668	u9	m0	PATRICK	And I'm in control of it.
L651	u5	m0	KAT	What?
L650	u9	m0	PATRICK	Kat! Wake up!
L646	u5	m0	KAT	You know what they say
L645	u9	m0	PATRICK	I thought you were above all that
"L644	u5	m0	KAT	Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
L643	u9	m0	PATRICK	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
L642	u5	m0	KAT	I hate him.
L641	u9	m0	PATRICK	Dorsey.
L640	u5	m0	KAT	Who?
L639	u9	m0	PATRICK	Why'd you let him get to you?
L636	u5	m0	KAT	Just let me sit down.
L635	u9	m0	PATRICK	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
L634	u5	m0	KAT	Like you could find one
L633	u9	m0	PATRICK	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
L632	u5	m0	KAT	Why?
L631	u9	m0	PATRICK	Sure I do
L630	u5	m0	KAT	You don't care if I die
L629	u9	m0	PATRICK	I told you
L628	u5	m0	KAT	Why 're you doing this?
L627	u9	m0	PATRICK	Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
L626	u5	m0	KAT	This is so patronizing.
L616	u9	m0	PATRICK	What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
L615	u5	m0	KAT	I know just let me sleep
L614	u9	m0	PATRICK	Uh uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
L613	u5	m0	KAT	I just need to lie down for awhile
L612	u9	m0	PATRICK	You're not okay.
L611	u5	m0	KAT	I'm fine. I'm
L610	u9	m0	PATRICK	Okay?
L567	u5	m0	KAT	Funny you're the only one
L566	u9	m0	PATRICK	I say do what you wanna do.
"L565	u5	m0	KAT	""I'm getting trashed man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"
L564	u9	m0	PATRICK	What's this?
L483	u9	m0	PATRICK	Why don't you?
L482	u5	m0	KAT	You know who The Raincoats are?
L481	u9	m0	PATRICK	You know these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats but they're right up there.
L477	u9	m0	PATRICK	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
L476	u5	m0	KAT	That's what you want isn't it?
L475	u9	m0	PATRICK	Excuse me?
L474	u5	m0	KAT	
L473	u9	m0	PATRICK	hey.  Great show huh?
L334	u5	m0	KAT	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
L333	u9	m0	PATRICK	You're not a big talker are you?
L332	u5	m0	KAT	Hi
L331	u9	m0	PATRICK	I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
L330	u5	m0	KAT	Are you following me?
L328	u9	m0	PATRICK	Seven-thirty?
L327	u5	m0	KAT	You -- covered in my vomit.
L326	u9	m0	PATRICK	Come on -- the ponies the flat beer you with money in your eyes me with my hand on your ass...
L325	u5	m0	KAT	And why would I do that?
L324	u9	m0	PATRICK	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
L323	u5	m0	KAT	I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
L322	u9	m0	PATRICK	You hate me don't you?
L313	u9	m0	PATRICK	I know a lot more than that
L312	u5	m0	KAT	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name screwboy?
L311	u9	m0	PATRICK	The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
L310	u5	m0	KAT	Oh right.  Friday.
L309	u9	m0	PATRICK	Pick you up Friday then
L307	u5	m0	KAT	My mission in life.
L306	u9	m0	PATRICK	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
L305	u5	m0	KAT	Sweating like a pig actually.  And yourself?
L304	u9	m0	PATRICK	I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
L1000	u11	m0	WALTER	Oh Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
L999	u5	m0	KAT	When I go?
L998	u11	m0	WALTER	You know fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence I won't even be able to watch the game.
L997	u11	m0	WALTER	No -- impressed.
L996	u5	m0	KAT	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
L995	u11	m0	WALTER	Bianca did what?
L994	u5	m0	KAT	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
L993	u11	m0	WALTER	Which parts?
L992	u5	m0	KAT	Parts of it.
L991	u11	m0	WALTER	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
L990	u5	m0	KAT	No Daddy.
L989	u11	m0	WALTER	I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
L988	u11	m0	WALTER	Funny.
L987	u5	m0	KAT	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
L986	u11	m0	WALTER	Was that your sister?
L347	u5	m0	KAT	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
L346	u11	m0	WALTER	You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
L345	u5	m0	KAT	So what I want doesn't matter?
L344	u11	m0	WALTER	As a parent that's my right
L343	u5	m0	KAT	Because you're making decisions for me.
L342	u11	m0	WALTER	Why can't we agree on this?
L341	u5	m0	KAT	I thought you were punishing me.
L340	u11	m0	WALTER	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
L339	u5	m0	KAT	Then tell them I had a seizure.
L338	u11	m0	WALTER	My insurance does not cover PMS
L185	u11	m0	WALTER	Enough!
L184	u5	m0	KAT	This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
L174	u5	m0	KAT	You decided.
L173	u11	m0	WALTER	I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
L172	u5	m0	KAT	I know.
L1018	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	Just smack her now.
L1017	u5	m0	KAT	Am I supposed to feel better? Like right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
"L109	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
L108	u5	m0	KAT	Tempestuous?
L107	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
L106	u5	m0	KAT	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
L105	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	Well yes compared to your other choices of expression this year today's events are quite mild.  By the way Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well in case you're interested.
L104	u5	m0	KAT	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
L103	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	Katarina Stratford.  My my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
L738	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Yeah...
L737	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Kat a fan too?
L736	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Right.
L735	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Macbeth right?
L733	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Oh yeah.
L732	u6	m0	MANDELLA	You think?
L731	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Yeah.  I guess.
L730	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
L729	u6	m0	MANDELLA	Hi.
L728	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
L777	u9	m0	PATRICK	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
L776	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Sweet love renew thy force!
L775	u9	m0	PATRICK	You were right. She's still pissed.
L724	u9	m0	PATRICK	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
L723	u7	m0	MICHAEL	So you got cozy with she who stings?
L437	u9	m0	PATRICK	I'm likin' you guys better
L436	u7	m0	MICHAEL	I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
L429	u9	m0	PATRICK	Yeah.
L428	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Ever been to Club Skunk?
L421	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Just for now.
"L420	u9	m0	PATRICK	Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"
L415	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Good enough.
L414	u9	m0	PATRICK	What?!
L384	u7	m0	MICHAEL	We're your guys.
L383	u9	m0	PATRICK	You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
L382	u7	m0	MICHAEL	Patrick Pat you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
L381	u9	m0	PATRICK	So Dorsey can get the girl?
L380	u7	m0	MICHAEL	That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
L379	u9	m0	PATRICK	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
L378	u7	m0	MICHAEL	I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
L377	u9	m0	PATRICK	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
L376	u7	m0	MICHAEL	The situation is my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
L375	u9	m0	PATRICK	What plan?
L373	u9	m0	PATRICK	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
L372	u7	m0	MICHAEL	What?
L371	u9	m0	PATRICK	Say it
L512	u9	m0	PATRICK	See you next week!
L511	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	You're completely demented.
L264	u9	m0	PATRICK	Well you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
L263	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	You weren't abused you aren't stupid and as far as I can tell you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
L262	u9	m0	PATRICK	What's to discuss?
L261	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
L259	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	I'm at a loss then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
L258	u9	m0	PATRICK	Touch of the flu.
L257	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	I don't understand Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
L62	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	With the teeth of your zipper?
L61	u9	m0	PATRICK	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
L60	u8	m0	MISS PERKY	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
L59	u9	m0	PATRICK	I missed you.
L933	u11	m0	WALTER	That ' s what I thought
L932	u10	m0	SHARON	Absolutely not.
L931	u11	m0	WALTER	Did I have anything to say about it?
L930	u10	m0	SHARON	Your daughters went to the prom.
L929	u11	m0	WALTER	What just happened?
L927	u11	m0	WALTER	But -- who -- what --?
L926	u10	m0	SHARON	Have a great time honey!
L918	u10	m0	SHARON	Dr. Ruth?
L917	u11	m0	WALTER	What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap crap crap or crap
L887	u11	m0	WALTER	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
L886	u10	m0	SHARON	They'll dance they'll kiss they'll come home.  Let her go.
L877	u11	m0	WALTER	Pirate -- no question.
L876	u10	m0	SHARON	Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
L193	u11	m0	WALTER	You're not helping.
L192	u10	m0	SHARON	Tumescent!
L191	u11	m0	WALTER	Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
L171	u11	m0	WALTER	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
L170	u10	m0	SHARON	What's a synonym for throbbing?
L162	u11	m0	WALTER	Make anyone cry today?
L161	u10	m0	SHARON	In the microwave.
L2181	u12	m1	ALONSO	Can't be that far I say.  Also I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
L2180	u23	m1	SAILOR	We left three weeks ago Alonso. Can't be that near.
L2179	u12	m1	ALONSO	We should have seen land.
L2177	u23	m1	SAILOR	We'll all go crazy...
L2176	u12	m1	ALONSO	He's the devil's child...
L2175	u12	m1	ALONSO	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
L2174	u23	m1	SAILOR	Ah leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
L2173	u12	m1	ALONSO	What are you listening to chicken ass?
L2172	u12	m1	ALONSO	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
L2171	u23	m1	SAILOR	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
L2170	u12	m1	ALONSO	I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
L2025	u13	m1	AROJAZ	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
L2024	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
L2023	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
L2022	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
L2020	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
L2019	u13	m1	AROJAZ	If God intended our proximity to Asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
L2016	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I too will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
L2015	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
L2014	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Trade Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
L2012	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If they agree to follow me yes.
L2011	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Your life and that of others!
L2010	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Eminence there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
L2006	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Excellency you are right.
L2005	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Senor Colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
L1993	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
L1992	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am Your Eminence
L1991	u13	m1	AROJAZ	Unfortunately Don Colon that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
L1990	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
L1989	u13	m1	AROJAZ	You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
L2524	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	A waste...?  Let me tell you something Arojaz.  If your name or mine is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
L2523	u13	m1	AROJAZ	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
L2522	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You can see for yourself.
L2275	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	On the contrary Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
L2274	u13	m1	AROJAZ	It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now Don Sanchez.
L2031	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
L2030	u13	m1	AROJAZ	He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
L2029	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
L2028	u13	m1	AROJAZ	The Judgment is ours!
L2027	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition Your Eminence...
L2540	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
L2539	u14	m1	BEATRIX	What is it now?  Tell me...
L2538	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I am busy inside.
L2537	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Can't you stay with us a little?
L2474	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich they only make him busier...
L2473	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They took everything...
L2472	u14	m1	BEATRIX	They tried... but I didn't let them.
L2471	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
L2320	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
L2319	u14	m1	BEATRIX	You don't usually ask.
L2318	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Beatrix I want to ask you something.
L2123	u14	m1	BEATRIX	That's something you can't decide.
L2122	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't want you to wait for me.
L2121	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
L2119	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Thank God...
L2118	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	She said yes.
L1986	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I find that hard to believe.
L1985	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
L1984	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
L1983	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Are we going to argue?
L1982	u14	m1	BEATRIX	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
L1981	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I haven't given you much of a life.
L1980	u14	m1	BEATRIX	I know.
L1979	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I could be gone for years.
L2432	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
L2431	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
L2430	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
L2429	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How far from here?
L2426	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
L2425	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Viceroy of the West Indies.
L2424	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Appointment to what?
L2423	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	My letters of appointment.
L2422	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... I remember...
L2421	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
L2293	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
L2292	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	May I ask by whom?
L2291	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
L2290	u15	m1	BOBADILLA	I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
L2552	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
L2551	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
L2550	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want you to tell me everything you remember Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
L2549	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
L2548	u17	m1	FERNANDO	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
L2547	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What does he say?
L2542	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I am not listening Father.  But I can't help hearing.
L2541	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What are you listening to?
L2501	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
L2500	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Father...
L2485	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Not bad.
L2484	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How are you feeling Fernando?
L2440	u17	m1	FERNANDO	This time with me!
L2439	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to explore the mainland.
L2131	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Yes... Yes I do... On all of them!
L2130	u17	m1	FERNANDO	Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
L2129	u17	m1	FERNANDO	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
L2128	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	There'll be a time.
L2127	u17	m1	FERNANDO	I want to go with you!
L2469	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them created by people like me.
L2468	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Roofs... towers palaces... spires...
L2467	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you see?
L2466	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Look out of that window.
L2465	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
L2464	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Call them.
L2463	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	All I have to do is call the guards.
L2301	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	To rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
L2300	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What...?  Do I have so many already?
L2299	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
L2297	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
L2296	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Don Bobadilla is already a judge my Dear Don Cristobal.
L2295	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
L2287	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... for a commoner?
L2286	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	You defend yourself admirably...
L2282	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Forgive me Don Colon.  But what about gold?
L2281	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
L2110	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	If you won't accept our proposal we'll simply find someone who will.
L2109	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And were you never ambitious Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us?
L2108	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then you are too ambitious.
L2107	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'm not bargaining!
L2106	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	I remind you Senor Colon that you are in no position to bargain with me.
L2105	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	NO...!  I have waited too long fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
L2104	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	No?
L2103	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No...
L2410	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You never learned how to speak my language.
L2409	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Utapan won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
L2394	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You did the same to your God!
L2393	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You have to find them Utapan.  Look what they did!
L2343	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ask him if he will help.
L2342	u25	m1	UTAPAN	He understands.
L2341	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
L2260	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
L2259	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says...
L2258	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	... and also to bring medicine.
L2257	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To bring the word of God.
L2255	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Why?
L2254	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thousands.
L2253	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief says -- how many?
L2251	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Chief knows.
L2249	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248	u25	m1	UTAPAN	You come!  You speak first!
L2239	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Island.  Far.
L2238	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237	u25	m1	UTAPAN	Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	New worlds create new people.
L2532	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I knew you would.
L2531	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I have to disagree.
L2526	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll always be older than me Father.
L2525	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Give me absolution.
L2144	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I believed in you...
L2143	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You are bound by an oath Father.
L2142	u19	m1	MARCHENA	My son my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If I tell them they won't follow me.  You know that I am right Father.  You trust me...
L2140	u19	m1	MARCHENA	May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How long?
L2137	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136	u19	m1	MARCHENA	What are you saying?
L2135	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134	u19	m1	MARCHENA	I am listening my son.
L2133	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Forgive me Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132	u19	m1	MARCHENA	In Nomine Patris et Filius et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!  Don't!
L2045	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	All of them!  Just lies!
L2042	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Colon!
L2040	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Damn God!
L2039	u19	m1	MARCHENA	If God intends you to go then you will go.
L2038	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Only God knows the meaning of such words my son.
L1968	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967	u19	m1	MARCHENA	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Father Marchena!
L1964	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I'll try to remember that Marchena...
L1963	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you Colon.
L1962	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	So was Christ!
L1961	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Esdras is a Jew.
L1960	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr Esdras...
L1959	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?
L1958	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957	u19	m1	MARCHENA	How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950	u19	m1	MARCHENA	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	How did you manage it?
L1948	u19	m1	MARCHENA	That's what it says.
L1947	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	God... That's in a week!
L1943	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Father I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942	u19	m1	MARCHENA	Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458	u18	m1	ISABEL	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back after all this?
L2457	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thank you.
L2456	u18	m1	ISABEL	But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279	u18	m1	ISABEL	Do they have such thoughts?
L2086	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Thirty seven Your Majesty... And you?
L2085	u18	m1	ISABEL	How old are you Senor Colon?
L2082	u18	m1	ISABEL	A woman?
"L2081	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
L2080	u18	m1	ISABEL	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	May I speak freely?
L2077	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076	u18	m1	ISABEL	I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075	u18	m1	ISABEL	That she was impregnable.
L2074	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073	u18	m1	ISABEL	The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071	u18	m1	ISABEL	I should not even be listening to you since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez that you are not a fool.
L2389	u21	m1	MOXICA	You will regret this.
L2388	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You'll be held in detention deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387	u21	m1	MOXICA	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	In one act of brutality you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348	u21	m1	MOXICA	You did not hear me Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346	u21	m1	MOXICA	My horse doesn't work.
L2345	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332	u21	m1	MOXICA	We don't need to know.
L2331	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders you'll do as I say.
L2328	u21	m1	MOXICA	We lost cousins friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The Indians have no such word Don Moxica.
L2277	u21	m1	MOXICA	And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492	u20	m1	MENDEZ	We can't be.
L2491	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490	u20	m1	MENDEZ	What's he doing?
L2165	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Twenty eight.
L2164	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	What do you read?
L2160	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Come over here.
L2159	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And what do you think Mendez?
L2157	u20	m1	MENDEZ	Well... It's the men Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155	u20	m1	MENDEZ	God be with us admiral.
L2154	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Due west Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210	u22	m1	PINZON	You tell that to them!
L2209	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Pinzon Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208	u22	m1	PINZON	You bloody...
L2207	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us remember?
L2206	u22	m1	PINZON	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	And then what?  Half of the water has gone the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204	u22	m1	PINZON	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon these are my ships right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	The land is there.  I know it!
L2202	u22	m1	PINZON	We're lost!
L2201	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	You think I don't know that?
L2200	u22	m1	PINZON	We're on the verge of a mutiny Colon!
L2199	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198	u22	m1	PINZON	You must be mad...!
L2197	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Six days ago yes.
L2196	u22	m1	PINZON	You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065	u22	m1	PINZON	Immediately.
L2064	u16	m1	COLUMBUS	Where can I meet this man?
L2462	u18	m1	ISABEL	Because he is not afraid of me.
L2461	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Then why?
L2460	u18	m1	ISABEL	I know I should not tolerate his impertinence.
L2419	u18	m1	ISABEL	And who would you think of for such a task?
L2418	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	He must be replaced.
L2417	u18	m1	ISABEL	Then what do you suggest Don Sanchez?
L2415	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is this true Brother Buyl?
L2414	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377	u18	m1	ISABEL	We weren't expecting immediate profits were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive Your Majesty.
L2116	u18	m1	ISABEL	Yes.  It would be a pity wouldn't it?  Call him back!
L2115	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	... Into a monk...
L2113	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Never Your Majesty.  Although...
L2112	u18	m1	ISABEL	You were right Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
L1931	u24	m1	SANCHEZ	Yes Your Majesty.
L1930	u18	m1	ISABEL	Is that the man I knew Treasurer Sanchez?
L3546	u26	m2	CUTLER	Officers there's your killer do your duty arrest him!
L3545	u30	m2	EMIL	...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital...
L3497	u26	m2	CUTLER	I don't think it's abuse I think it's torture.
L3496	u30	m2	EMIL	I'm abused.  Don't you think?
L3493	u26	m2	CUTLER	Can I see your back?
L3492	u30	m2	EMIL	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
L3491	u26	m2	CUTLER	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
L3490	u30	m2	EMIL	That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
L3489	u30	m2	EMIL	Yeah he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
L3488	u26	m2	CUTLER	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
L3487	u30	m2	EMIL	Yeah yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
L3486	u26	m2	CUTLER	Back in the Czech Republic?
L3485	u30	m2	EMIL	Yeah she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
L3484	u26	m2	CUTLER	Your mother was blind?
L3483	u30	m2	EMIL	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
L3482	u26	m2	CUTLER	Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
L3481	u30	m2	EMIL	Give me another one please.
L3480	u26	m2	CUTLER	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
L3479	u30	m2	EMIL	What else do you need?
L3478	u26	m2	CUTLER	This is not about money Emil.  I need your trust in me.
L3477	u30	m2	EMIL	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
L3476	u26	m2	CUTLER	But it's...
L3475	u30	m2	EMIL	No.  No way.
L3474	u26	m2	CUTLER	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
L3473	u30	m2	EMIL	What's your cut?  How much?
L3472	u26	m2	CUTLER	Look I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
L3471	u30	m2	EMIL	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
L3470	u26	m2	CUTLER	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
L3469	u30	m2	EMIL	No he is here.  Shit...
L3468	u26	m2	CUTLER	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
L3467	u30	m2	EMIL	What about Oleg?
L3466	u26	m2	CUTLER	Well you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
L3465	u30	m2	EMIL	I was all of these.
L3464	u26	m2	CUTLER	...delusions and paranoia.
L3461	u26	m2	CUTLER	Oh sure.
L3460	u30	m2	EMIL	You bring the cigarettes?
L3459	u26	m2	CUTLER	I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes another sent a check. Another wants a check.
L3396	u26	m2	CUTLER	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
L3395	u30	m2	EMIL	Yes.  Yes come with me!
L3394	u26	m2	CUTLER	I'm coming with you.
L3393	u30	m2	EMIL	Where are we going?
L3392	u26	m2	CUTLER	Don't say anything.
L3385	u30	m2	EMIL	He has the camera!  He took the movie!
L3384	u26	m2	CUTLER	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
L3383	u30	m2	EMIL	Oh no!  No!  Shit!
L3382	u30	m2	EMIL	Here.  I have your money.
L3381	u26	m2	CUTLER	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
L3380	u30	m2	EMIL	Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
L3517	u34	m2	JORDY	Daphne I...
L3516	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I don't want to drag you down with me.
L3515	u34	m2	JORDY	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
L3514	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
L3330	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Pouring it out!
L3329	u34	m2	JORDY	What are you doing?
L3318	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I'll get my clothes.
L3317	u34	m2	JORDY	I'll make some for us.
L3316	u27	m2	DAPHNE	In the kitchen.
L3315	u34	m2	JORDY	Do you have coffee?
L3314	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Right.
L3313	u34	m2	JORDY	You better get packed.
L3311	u34	m2	JORDY	I'm glad I met you.
L3310	u27	m2	DAPHNE	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
L3309	u34	m2	JORDY	A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
L3308	u27	m2	DAPHNE	If you were my boyfriend I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
L3307	u34	m2	JORDY	If I was your boyfriend I might be.
L3306	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
L3305	u34	m2	JORDY	Is he your boyfriend?
L3302	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I'm sorry.
L3301	u34	m2	JORDY	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
L3300	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Are you alright?
L3181	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
L3180	u34	m2	JORDY	They're not gonna send you right back.
L3179	u27	m2	DAPHNE	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
L3178	u34	m2	JORDY	I know.
L3177	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
L3170	u34	m2	JORDY	I'm just trying to find out who you are.
L3169	u27	m2	DAPHNE	What are you asking me?
L3168	u34	m2	JORDY	So you were never a prostitute?
L3167	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
L3166	u27	m2	DAPHNE	No.
L3165	u34	m2	JORDY	What about back home?
L3164	u27	m2	DAPHNE	No.
L3163	u34	m2	JORDY	Did you ever turn tricks before?
L3162	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Yes I considered it.
L3161	u34	m2	JORDY	You considered becoming a prostitute?
L3160	u34	m2	JORDY	Yeah.  This way.
L3159	u27	m2	DAPHNE	So...the station is empty?
L3158	u34	m2	JORDY	The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
L3097	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Somewhere else?
L3096	u34	m2	JORDY	I can't take you to my place.
L3095	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
L3094	u34	m2	JORDY	Divorced.
L3093	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Are you married?
L3092	u34	m2	JORDY	They won't until this is over.
L3091	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I will if they don't send me back.
L3090	u34	m2	JORDY	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
L3089	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Now I become custody of police department?
L3061	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Yes but he was a cop.
L3060	u34	m2	JORDY	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
L3059	u27	m2	DAPHNE	...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
L3065	u27	m2	DAPHNE	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
L3064	u29	m2	EDDIE	Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
L3063	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
L3062	u29	m2	EDDIE	A cop?
L3056	u27	m2	DAPHNE	No no don't talk to Immigration!
L3055	u29	m2	EDDIE	Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
L3051	u29	m2	EDDIE	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
L3050	u27	m2	DAPHNE	If I tell you will you arrest me?
L3049	u29	m2	EDDIE	Whether you tell us or not we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
L3048	u29	m2	EDDIE	Go on.
L3047	u27	m2	DAPHNE	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken she let me use theirs.
L3046	u29	m2	EDDIE	C'mon start at the beginning.  You know these people?
L3045	u27	m2	DAPHNE	I told your partner I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
L3214	u28	m2	DUFFY	Yeah sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
L3213	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
L3212	u28	m2	DUFFY	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
L3211	u29	m2	EDDIE	Look after Jordy briefs me you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
L3210	u28	m2	DUFFY	Well I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
L3209	u29	m2	EDDIE	It was my decision not his.
L3208	u28	m2	DUFFY	Oh.
L3506	u28	m2	DUFFY	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
L3505	u34	m2	JORDY	But Chief?  Over this??
L3504	u28	m2	DUFFY	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
L3503	u34	m2	JORDY	End my career?
L3502	u28	m2	DUFFY	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
L3501	u34	m2	JORDY	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
L3500	u28	m2	DUFFY	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
L3499	u34	m2	JORDY	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
L3498	u28	m2	DUFFY	The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
L3294	u28	m2	DUFFY	Okay.  But not water sports.
L3293	u34	m2	JORDY	Chief - mind if I take her?
L3203	u28	m2	DUFFY	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
L3202	u34	m2	JORDY	No!  Nothing happened.
L3201	u28	m2	DUFFY	A shower!?  Did you take one too?
L3200	u34	m2	JORDY	I let her take a shower.
L3199	u28	m2	DUFFY	What do you mean 'cleaned up?'
L3198	u34	m2	JORDY	Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
L3197	u28	m2	DUFFY	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
L3196	u34	m2	JORDY	Hey Chief what are you doing here?
L2800	u34	m2	JORDY	'Cause we got more important things to do like finding out who did it.
L2799	u28	m2	DUFFY	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
L2798	u34	m2	JORDY	Who do you think Chief?!
L2797	u28	m2	DUFFY	Who did cause and origin?
L3292	u35	m2	KORFIN	Yeah.
L3291	u28	m2	DUFFY	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
L3290	u35	m2	KORFIN	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
L3289	u28	m2	DUFFY	Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
L2805	u28	m2	DUFFY	You do that wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
L2804	u35	m2	KORFIN	I said yeah you're right Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
L2803	u28	m2	DUFFY	What was that Korfin?
L2802	u35	m2	KORFIN	Yeah right.
L2801	u28	m2	DUFFY	Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
L3028	u29	m2	EDDIE	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry we'll get those fuckers.
L3027	u36	m2	LEON	He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
L3023	u36	m2	LEON	No.  I'm okay.
L3022	u29	m2	EDDIE	Are you hit?
L3017	u36	m2	LEON	Stay with her.
L3016	u29	m2	EDDIE	The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
L2938	u29	m2	EDDIE	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
L2937	u36	m2	LEON	Yeah.
L2936	u29	m2	EDDIE	Only one guys checked in?
L2925	u29	m2	EDDIE	It's okay.
L2924	u36	m2	LEON	Sorry...PD only.
L2923	u36	m2	LEON	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
L2922	u29	m2	EDDIE	Any I.D.?
L2921	u36	m2	LEON	Takin' a bath.
L2920	u29	m2	EDDIE	Where is she?
L2752	u29	m2	EDDIE	A timer.
L2751	u36	m2	LEON	What's he looking for?
L2633	u36	m2	LEON	You ready?
L2632	u29	m2	EDDIE	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
L2631	u36	m2	LEON	When?
L2630	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'm gonna propose.
L2603	u29	m2	EDDIE	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
L2602	u36	m2	LEON	It was freaky I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
L2601	u36	m2	LEON	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
L2600	u29	m2	EDDIE	Vodka tonic.
L2599	u36	m2	LEON	Coffee for me I gotta slow down.
L2990	u44	m2	ROSE	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
L2989	u29	m2	EDDIE	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
L2988	u44	m2	ROSE	Tall short-haired scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
L2987	u29	m2	EDDIE	Describe him.
L2986	u44	m2	ROSE	He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
L2981	u44	m2	ROSE	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her too.
L2980	u29	m2	EDDIE	What are you saying?
L2979	u44	m2	ROSE	Boy she's so popular all the sudden.
L2978	u29	m2	EDDIE	Did you tell him you did?
L2977	u44	m2	ROSE	No.
L2976	u29	m2	EDDIE	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
L2975	u44	m2	ROSE	Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there you know it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
L2973	u44	m2	ROSE	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
L2972	u29	m2	EDDIE	We don't have her I.D. yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
L2971	u44	m2	ROSE	What's wrong?
L2967	u29	m2	EDDIE	Homicide Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
L2966	u44	m2	ROSE	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
L2965	u29	m2	EDDIE	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
L2964	u44	m2	ROSE	Who's there?
L3230	u29	m2	EDDIE	You know I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time but I still kept him.
L3229	u34	m2	JORDY	Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
L3228	u29	m2	EDDIE	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there they know your face.  And the little fame the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
L3227	u34	m2	JORDY	But I mean didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
L3226	u29	m2	EDDIE	Well it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand that's why you're a professional.
L3225	u34	m2	JORDY	I told you you know I thought I was doing the right thing you know I think she's innocent.
L3224	u29	m2	EDDIE	No I don't think you were a fool I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean to say the least you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
L3223	u34	m2	JORDY	Yeah just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up but...
L3222	u29	m2	EDDIE	Just a shower?
L3221	u34	m2	JORDY	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
L3220	u29	m2	EDDIE	Well you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
L3219	u34	m2	JORDY	Look Eddie I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
L3082	u29	m2	EDDIE	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
L3081	u34	m2	JORDY	Hey.  I'm a professional.
L3080	u29	m2	EDDIE	Okay tell you what I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
L3079	u34	m2	JORDY	You know what I'm saying here.
L3078	u29	m2	EDDIE	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
L3077	u34	m2	JORDY	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
L3076	u29	m2	EDDIE	So am I.
L3075	u34	m2	JORDY	I'm serious here.
L3074	u29	m2	EDDIE	My point exactly.
L3073	u34	m2	JORDY	I don't have a girlfriend.
L3072	u29	m2	EDDIE	What would your girlfriend think of that?
L3071	u34	m2	JORDY	Yeah.
L3070	u29	m2	EDDIE	You wanna talk to her alone?
L3069	u34	m2	JORDY	Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
L3068	u34	m2	JORDY	Raw deal.
L3067	u29	m2	EDDIE	She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
L3058	u29	m2	EDDIE	Something back home?
L3057	u34	m2	JORDY	Why not?
L3054	u29	m2	EDDIE	Is that all there is?
L3053	u34	m2	JORDY	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
L3052	u29	m2	EDDIE	What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
L2999	u29	m2	EDDIE	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
L2998	u34	m2	JORDY	I wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid.
L2997	u29	m2	EDDIE	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
L2996	u34	m2	JORDY	Of course.
L2995	u29	m2	EDDIE	So am I.  Alright I'll go inside and you cover the back.
L2994	u34	m2	JORDY	I'm on duty.
L2993	u29	m2	EDDIE	You thirsty?
L2992	u34	m2	JORDY	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
L2991	u29	m2	EDDIE	Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
L2963	u29	m2	EDDIE	Better than one.
L2962	u34	m2	JORDY	Two heads.
L2958	u34	m2	JORDY	I'll call it... tails.
L2957	u29	m2	EDDIE	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win you don't come.
L2956	u34	m2	JORDY	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
L2955	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'll let you know what happens.
L2953	u34	m2	JORDY	But what if it does?  You might need my help.
L2952	u29	m2	EDDIE	This has nothing to do with your fire.
L2951	u34	m2	JORDY	Mind if I ride along with you?
L2950	u29	m2	EDDIE	You got any better ideas?
L2949	u34	m2	JORDY	You goin' to the escort service?
L2906	u29	m2	EDDIE	Stay here.
L2905	u34	m2	JORDY	My folks are.
L2904	u29	m2	EDDIE	You're Polish?
L2903	u34	m2	JORDY	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
L2902	u29	m2	EDDIE	This isn't homicide school.
L2901	u34	m2	JORDY	I can watch you Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
L2900	u29	m2	EDDIE	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
L2899	u34	m2	JORDY	I'll come with you.
L2897	u34	m2	JORDY	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
L2896	u29	m2	EDDIE	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
L2895	u34	m2	JORDY	Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up no proper funeral it's like condemning them to hell.
L2893	u34	m2	JORDY	Look I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
L2892	u29	m2	EDDIE	What would you call her?
L2891	u34	m2	JORDY	Who says she's a suspect?
L2890	u29	m2	EDDIE	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
L2889	u34	m2	JORDY	Hmmmm.
L2888	u29	m2	EDDIE	Pretty.
L2887	u34	m2	JORDY	The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
L2886	u29	m2	EDDIE	You were right they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
L2885	u34	m2	JORDY	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off too.  What about the report?
L2884	u29	m2	EDDIE	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
L2883	u34	m2	JORDY	Did you get a report from the M.E.?
L2882	u29	m2	EDDIE	Good.  Good.  Commendable.
L2881	u34	m2	JORDY	I don't even watch TV.
L2880	u29	m2	EDDIE	Nah why should you?
L2879	u34	m2	JORDY	Well just so you know I don't care about that stuff.
L2878	u29	m2	EDDIE	Well just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
L2877	u34	m2	JORDY	Nah I musta missed it.
L2876	u29	m2	EDDIE	Watch the news?
L2875	u34	m2	JORDY	It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
L2748	u34	m2	JORDY	Why don't you explain it Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
L2747	u29	m2	EDDIE	No what is it?
L2746	u34	m2	JORDY	You know what that is right?
L2731	u29	m2	EDDIE	No we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
L2730	u34	m2	JORDY	Hey that's great you guys got it all wrapped up but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
L3249	u30	m2	EMIL	Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
L3248	u29	m2	EDDIE	You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
L3244	u29	m2	EDDIE	If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
L3243	u30	m2	EMIL	So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
L3242	u30	m2	EMIL	Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
L3241	u29	m2	EDDIE	Then do it asshole.
L3240	u30	m2	EMIL	I kill someone famous.
L3239	u29	m2	EDDIE	What's your accomplishment.
L3238	u30	m2	EMIL	Your opinion.  You see they going to make a movie about me too Eddie.  And write books.
L3237	u29	m2	EDDIE	What do you want?
L3236	u30	m2	EMIL	So...who's Nicky?
L3157	u29	m2	EDDIE	Don't be late.
L3156	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Thank you.
L3155	u29	m2	EDDIE	See you later.  Good luck.
L3154	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.
L3153	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah yeah.  Good thing.
L3152	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.  And you know what I'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
L3151	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah.  I promise.
L3150	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	You promise?
L3149	u29	m2	EDDIE	Tonight.
L3148	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay til tonight.

L3144	u29	m2	EDDIE	I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead just imagine that uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
L3143	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Promise?
L3142	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
L3141	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	No.  No listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know the shoe thing and the marriages and...
L3140	u29	m2	EDDIE	No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
L3139	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now we're in the middle of something here.
L3138	u29	m2	EDDIE	Well that's great.
L3137	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Yeah.
L3136	u29	m2	EDDIE	That's good.
L3135	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Oh my G-d they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
L3130	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
L3129	u29	m2	EDDIE	Answer it.
L3128	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	No.  Tell me what you want to say.
L3127	u29	m2	EDDIE	Answer the phone.
L3126	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
L3121	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
L3120	u29	m2	EDDIE	Could be Leon's.
L3119	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
L3117	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	You're not so bad yourself.
L3116	u29	m2	EDDIE	You're ruthless.
L3115	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Well who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
L3114	u29	m2	EDDIE	You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
L3113	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
L3112	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
L3111	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
L3110	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'm not.
L3109	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Alright alright Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
L3108	u29	m2	EDDIE	Maybe I should just ya know...turn to the cameras and say do you mind if we just work something out?
L3107	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Stop it.
L3106	u29	m2	EDDIE	Oh I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you sweetheart?  Oh...
L3105	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
L3104	u29	m2	EDDIE	I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
L3103	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
L3102	u29	m2	EDDIE	Hey.
L3101	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Hey honey.
L3044	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.
L3043	u29	m2	EDDIE	Alright.
L3042	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Alright.
L3041	u29	m2	EDDIE	Alright?
L3040	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Alright.
L3039	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
L3038	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Eddie are you okay?
L3037	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Alright cut cut cut.
L3036	u29	m2	EDDIE	Um...now is not a good time okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
L3035	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Do you have the suspect in custody?
L3034	u29	m2	EDDIE	He was hurt but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
L3033	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Okay.  But I do understand that your partner Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
L3032	u29	m2	EDDIE	I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
L3031	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	I understand but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
L3030	u29	m2	EDDIE	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
L3029	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
L2765	u29	m2	EDDIE	We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
L2764	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Is it drug related?
L2763	u29	m2	EDDIE	You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
L2762	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Can we go up to the crime scene?
L2761	u29	m2	EDDIE	There are two bodies found at this point.
L2760	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	How many victims are up there?
L2759	u29	m2	EDDIE	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
L2758	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Detective does it look like a murder?
L2665	u29	m2	EDDIE	Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
L2664	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Any chance we can do that again?
L2656	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah yeah.  Jesus.
L2655	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Okay.  You ready?
L2654	u29	m2	EDDIE	Keep them out of my way.
L2653	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Ready?
L2652	u31	m2	HAWKINS	You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
L2651	u29	m2	EDDIE	I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
L2648	u29	m2	EDDIE	Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
L2647	u31	m2	HAWKINS	That's unique.
L2646	u29	m2	EDDIE	He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
L2645	u29	m2	EDDIE	Not what.  Who.
L2644	u31	m2	HAWKINS	So what's unique?
L2612	u31	m2	HAWKINS	My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life they make you a better person they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right Leon?
L2611	u29	m2	EDDIE	How old are your kids?
L2607	u29	m2	EDDIE	I'm not moody.
L2606	u31	m2	HAWKINS	I think you're getting a little moody there Eddie.
L2605	u29	m2	EDDIE	Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
L2604	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Sooner or later that's everybody.
L2596	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Jesus Christ.
L2595	u29	m2	EDDIE	So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
L2628	u30	m2	EMIL	No.  Are you proposing?
L2627	u45	m2	SECONDARY OFFICER	Are you married?
L2626	u30	m2	EMIL	Dog food.
L2625	u45	m2	SECONDARY OFFICER	And what do you do with the bones?
L2624	u30	m2	EMIL	You stuff sausage in it.
L2623	u45	m2	SECONDARY OFFICER	You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
L2622	u30	m2	EMIL	I am butcher.
L2621	u45	m2	SECONDARY OFFICER	Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
L3286	u30	m2	EMIL	Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
L3285	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
L3284	u30	m2	EMIL	If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
L3283	u31	m2	HAWKINS	What?  It doesn't work that way.
L3282	u30	m2	EMIL	We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
L3281	u31	m2	HAWKINS	I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
L3280	u30	m2	EMIL	No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
L3279	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
L3278	u30	m2	EMIL	Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
L3556	u30	m2	EMIL	If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
L3555	u34	m2	JORDY	Let her go!  Let her go!!
L3554	u30	m2	EMIL	Tell him to put his gun down!
L3436	u30	m2	EMIL	The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
L3435	u34	m2	JORDY	Where's your partner?
L3434	u34	m2	JORDY	Get down on your knees.
L3433	u30	m2	EMIL	C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh look you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
L3432	u34	m2	JORDY	You'll be my first.
L3431	u30	m2	EMIL	You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
L3421	u34	m2	JORDY	Tommy take a walk.
L3420	u30	m2	EMIL	My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
L3419	u34	m2	JORDY	Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?

L2914	u48	m2	VENDOR	Hey tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look you want magazine or not?
L2913	u30	m2	EMIL	Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
L2912	u48	m2	VENDOR	In here says he wants a million.
L2911	u30	m2	EMIL	Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
L2910	u48	m2	VENDOR	This all you want?
L2909	u48	m2	VENDOR	New York's finest.  This is his case.
L2908	u30	m2	EMIL	Who is he?
L3548	u42	m2	OLEG	No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
L3547	u30	m2	EMIL	Traitor!!
L3378	u30	m2	EMIL	You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
L3377	u42	m2	OLEG	No I don't get that!
L3376	u30	m2	EMIL	You got that?
L3375	u30	m2	EMIL	Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
L3374	u42	m2	OLEG	Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
L3373	u30	m2	EMIL	Credit?
L3372	u42	m2	OLEG	I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
L3370	u30	m2	EMIL	Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
L3369	u42	m2	OLEG	Because I am the director.  Don't you realize if it wasn't for my film for my talent my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
L3368	u30	m2	EMIL	Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
L3366	u42	m2	OLEG	Be quiet.  Watch.
L3365	u30	m2	EMIL	I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
L3364	u30	m2	EMIL	Bad last moment - I cut it out.
L3363	u42	m2	OLEG	This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
L3362	u30	m2	EMIL	Shut up.  Look!
L3361	u42	m2	OLEG	I'm serious.
L3360	u30	m2	EMIL	The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
L3359	u42	m2	OLEG	In movie they make of us who do you think would act me?
L3357	u30	m2	EMIL	Oleg don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
L3356	u42	m2	OLEG	You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
L3251	u42	m2	OLEG	Cut!
L3250	u30	m2	EMIL	Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
L3247	u42	m2	OLEG	Good idea!
L3246	u30	m2	EMIL	No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free rich and famous!
L3193	u42	m2	OLEG	This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
L3192	u30	m2	EMIL	Sit down!
L3191	u42	m2	OLEG	Let me get a shot of it.
L3190	u30	m2	EMIL	What does it look like?  It's an address book!
L3189	u42	m2	OLEG	What is that?
L3188	u30	m2	EMIL	Put the camera down Oleg.
L3187	u42	m2	OLEG	Why not?
L3186	u30	m2	EMIL	And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either did you?  Don't lie I won't be angry.
L3185	u42	m2	OLEG	I did.
L3184	u30	m2	EMIL	The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
L3183	u42	m2	OLEG	What is it?
L3088	u30	m2	EMIL	Don't want to film this?
L3087	u42	m2	OLEG	Oh shit.  I hate looking at that!
L3085	u42	m2	OLEG	Does it hurt?
L3084	u30	m2	EMIL	Shut up.
L3083	u42	m2	OLEG	Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
L2844	u30	m2	EMIL	Oleg get in bathroom stay there and shut up!
L2843	u42	m2	OLEG	Whatever we do - we fuck her right?
L2842	u30	m2	EMIL	Get in the bathroom!
L2790	u30	m2	EMIL	I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
L2789	u42	m2	OLEG	Whore?
L2783	u42	m2	OLEG	I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
L2782	u30	m2	EMIL	How you erase this?
L2781	u42	m2	OLEG	You said speak Czech!
L2780	u30	m2	EMIL	Speak English!
L2779	u42	m2	OLEG	I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
L2778	u30	m2	EMIL	Turn that fucking thing off!
L2671	u30	m2	EMIL	Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
L2670	u42	m2	OLEG	What?
L2668	u30	m2	EMIL	For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse Oleg.
L2667	u42	m2	OLEG	Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
L2666	u30	m2	EMIL	Turn that off!  Get the bags.
L2640	u30	m2	EMIL	We have no money.  Come on.
L2639	u42	m2	OLEG	Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
L2638	u30	m2	EMIL	Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
L2637	u42	m2	OLEG	Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
L2636	u30	m2	EMIL	Don't speak Russian!
L2635	u42	m2	OLEG	Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
L2562	u42	m2	OLEG	I want to document my trip to America.
L2561	u30	m2	EMIL	Did you hear what I said?
L2560	u42	m2	OLEG	Okay.
L2559	u30	m2	EMIL	Don't fool around.
L2558	u42	m2	OLEG	Okay.
L2557	u30	m2	EMIL	Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
L2692	u30	m2	EMIL	You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
L2691	u39	m2	MILOS	We started over you can too.
L2690	u30	m2	EMIL	A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
L2689	u39	m2	MILOS	It's easy to learn.
L2688	u30	m2	EMIL	As a plumber?!
L2687	u39	m2	MILOS	Yes the money is good.
L2686	u30	m2	EMIL	A job?
L2685	u39	m2	MILOS	I can get you a job.
L2682	u39	m2	MILOS	Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
L2681	u30	m2	EMIL	Ha. Ha.
L2680	u39	m2	MILOS	We spent it!
L2679	u30	m2	EMIL	Milos.  Get my money!
L2678	u39	m2	MILOS	Take your eyes off her Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
L2676	u30	m2	EMIL	You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
L2675	u39	m2	MILOS	Did you hurt her?
L2674	u30	m2	EMIL	Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
L2673	u30	m2	EMIL	Surprise!  Surprise!
L2672	u39	m2	MILOS	Emil???!
L3353	u37	m2	MAGGIE	You want the tape?  There it is!
L3352	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Viewer discretion advised!
L3275	u37	m2	MAGGIE	Trust me you'll want to take this call.
L3274	u31	m2	HAWKINS	I can't talk to anybody right now can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
L3273	u37	m2	MAGGIE	You've got a call.
L3272	u31	m2	HAWKINS	What are you doing here?
L3271	u37	m2	MAGGIE	Robert...?
L3413	u36	m2	LEON	Don't give me that fucking shit.
L3412	u31	m2	HAWKINS	If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
L3411	u36	m2	LEON	You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
L3410	u31	m2	HAWKINS	This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries they'll convict him.
L3409	u36	m2	LEON	And you you'll pay for what you did!
L2615	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Paulie you've got kids right?

L2609	u36	m2	LEON	Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
L2608	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Isn't he a little moody?
L3269	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
L3268	u31	m2	HAWKINS	That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
L3267	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	Alright.  Go ahead.
L3266	u31	m2	HAWKINS	I'm trying to tell you.
L3265	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	I want to hear everything he said.
L3264	u31	m2	HAWKINS	Well he...
L3263	u41	m2	NICOLETTE	What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
L3262	u31	m2	HAWKINS	I know.
L2591	u33	m2	IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Excuse me?
"L2590	u42	m2	OLEG	Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."
L2589	u33	m2	IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
L2588	u42	m2	OLEG	I'm here for movies.

L2584	u42	m2	OLEG	New York.
L2583	u33	m2	IMMIGRATION OFFICER	Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
L2582	u42	m2	OLEG	I speak English.

L3403	u34	m2	JORDY	He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
L3402	u36	m2	LEON	Well he killed my partner!
L3401	u34	m2	JORDY	He's my collar!
L3400	u36	m2	LEON	We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
L3399	u34	m2	JORDY	No way!  He's mine!
L3398	u36	m2	LEON	I'll take him.
L2745	u34	m2	JORDY	Evidence.  Of a homicide.
L2744	u36	m2	LEON	What was that?
L2743	u36	m2	LEON	Yeah well some people got their priorities straight.
L2742	u34	m2	JORDY	And while they're burning up they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
L2741	u36	m2	LEON	That's what it looks like to me.
L2740	u34	m2	JORDY	So the way you see it two crack heads burned themselves up?
L2733	u34	m2	JORDY	Thanks.  Appreciate it.
L2732	u36	m2	LEON	No.  Go ahead.
L2773	u34	m2	JORDY	Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.

L2771	u34	m2	JORDY	You okay?
L2707	u40	m2	MUGGER	Hey.  C'mon you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
L2706	u34	m2	JORDY	I'll send a cop back for you.
L2703	u34	m2	JORDY	Oh yeah?  Guess again.
L2702	u40	m2	MUGGER	Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
L2701	u34	m2	JORDY	Okay you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
L2700	u40	m2	MUGGER	Alright how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
L2699	u34	m2	JORDY	Look I don't have time for you get out of my way!!
L2698	u40	m2	MUGGER	Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
L2813	u38	m2	MAX	Hey by the way I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
L2812	u34	m2	JORDY	Yeah?  What kind?
L2811	u38	m2	MAX	I used an accelerant.
L2810	u34	m2	JORDY	How did you start the fire this time?
L2809	u38	m2	MAX	Yeah I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now are you guys gonna arrest me or not?
L2808	u34	m2	JORDY	What's that on your forehead Max? That's a nice attention getter.
L3344	u34	m2	JORDY	They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
L3343	u35	m2	KORFIN	What the hell happened?
L3342	u34	m2	JORDY	Get outta here!
L3288	u34	m2	JORDY	Not good.
L3287	u35	m2	KORFIN	How was it?
L3026	u34	m2	JORDY	Lay down.  Stay down Bobby.
L3025	u35	m2	KORFIN	It hurts.  Aw Jesus!
L3024	u34	m2	JORDY	Bobby Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
L2872	u34	m2	JORDY	If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
L2871	u35	m2	KORFIN	Aren't you tired?
L2870	u34	m2	JORDY	You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
L2865	u35	m2	KORFIN	You hear that question Garcia?
L2864	u34	m2	JORDY	How long they been livin' here?
L2863	u35	m2	KORFIN	-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
L2795	u34	m2	JORDY	Maybe you can be his stand-in.
L2794	u35	m2	KORFIN	Yeah?
L2793	u34	m2	JORDY	Now that you know him maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
L2768	u34	m2	JORDY	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
L2767	u35	m2	KORFIN	What?
L2757	u34	m2	JORDY	That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
L2756	u35	m2	KORFIN	What??
L2755	u34	m2	JORDY	He knew all along.
L2754	u35	m2	KORFIN	You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
L2739	u35	m2	KORFIN	But you knew that right?
L2738	u34	m2	JORDY	The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
L2737	u34	m2	JORDY	Don't blow your nose!
L2736	u35	m2	KORFIN	Clean?
L2735	u34	m2	JORDY	Mouth's clean too.
L2725	u34	m2	JORDY	Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
L2724	u35	m2	KORFIN	Nah not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
L2721	u35	m2	KORFIN	'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
L2720	u34	m2	JORDY	Oh yeah why?
L2719	u35	m2	KORFIN	Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
L2718	u34	m2	JORDY	You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
L2717	u35	m2	KORFIN	I don't know you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
L2716	u34	m2	JORDY	I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
L2715	u35	m2	KORFIN	Where you been man?  We got a celebrity!
L3427	u34	m2	JORDY	GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU TOO!!!
L3426	u47	m2	TOMMY	Look you can't shoot him in cold blood.
L3425	u34	m2	JORDY	Take the car.  Get outta here Tommy.
L3424	u47	m2	TOMMY	Don't stoop to his level!
L3423	u34	m2	JORDY	Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
L3422	u47	m2	TOMMY	What are you gonna do?
L2930	u47	m2	TOMMY	The clerk?
L2929	u34	m2	JORDY	Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
L2928	u47	m2	TOMMY	Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
L2840	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
L2839	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
L2838	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	We're in negotiations that's correct.
L2837	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
L2836	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	Look I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
L2835	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it jump started your career as an artist?
L2834	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	Look I'm a victim here too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
L2833	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
L2832	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	It was my finger that pulled the trigger but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
L2831	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
L2830	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
L2829	u43	m2	ROBERT HAWKINS	Your doctor?
L2828	u46	m2	STEPHEN GELLER	This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
L3778	u55	m3	FLOYD	We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
L3777	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3771	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry Dr. Smyslov but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
L3770	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3757	u55	m3	FLOYD	How did they manage to do that without any communication?
L3756	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3750	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
L3749	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3729	u55	m3	FLOYD	She's wonderful.
L3728	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3721	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes but I'd love to.
L3720	u49	m3	B20	CONTINUED
L3713	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well how nice to see you again Elena. You're looking wonderful.
L3712	u49	m3	B20	SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
L4300	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Roger.
L4299	u60	m3	POOLE	I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
L4298	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess not.
L4297	u60	m3	POOLE	I guess you don't know your own strength old boy.
L4296	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
L4283	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well now that we've got one that's actually failed we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
L4282	u60	m3	POOLE	It's the last one.
L4209	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L4208	u60	m3	POOLE	Hal?
L4199	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
L4198	u60	m3	POOLE	Two more.
L4197	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
L4196	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
L4193	u60	m3	POOLE	No.
L4192	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You're kidding.
L4191	u60	m3	POOLE	Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
L4190	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh I'm fine I'm wide awake. What's up?
L4189	u60	m3	POOLE	Are you reasonably awake?
L4188	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Good morning. How's it going?
L4163	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Anyway it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
L4162	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
L4161	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
L4160	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes I don't know what to make of it.
L4159	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well that's something.
L4017	u60	m3	POOLE	Still all we have to do is ask Hal.
L4016	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I guess it isn't.
L4015	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
L4014	u50	m3	BOWMAN	But not completely inconceivable?
L4013	u60	m3	POOLE	I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
L4012	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
L4011	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. Though it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
L4001	u60	m3	POOLE	That's true.
L4000	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
L3999	u60	m3	POOLE	How?
L3998	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Of course it would be very easy for us to find out now.
L3997	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes I thought so.
L3996	u50	m3	BOWMAN	That seems very unlikely.
L3995	u60	m3	POOLE	I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
L3992	u60	m3	POOLE	Oh well apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
L3991	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No as a matter of fact I didn't.
L3990	u60	m3	POOLE	Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
L3989	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Oh?
L3988	u60	m3	POOLE	I suppose so. Though of course there's a more sinister explanation.
L3987	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I suppose the idea was specialized training.
L3984	u50	m3	BOWMAN	No. I never did either.
L3983	u60	m3	POOLE	I must say I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
L3982	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
L3981	u60	m3	POOLE	Well what do you think we ought to do about it?
L3980	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It's possible.
L3979	u60	m3	POOLE	Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
L3976	u60	m3	POOLE	Yesterday I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either.
L3975	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes.
L3974	u60	m3	POOLE	Really.
L3973	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Interesting that you mention it because I've got the same problem.
L3972	u60	m3	POOLE	That's right. Well naturally I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
L3969	u60	m3	POOLE	Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
L3968	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes?
L3967	u60	m3	POOLE	It's about my salary cheques.
L3966	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What's up?
L3965	u60	m3	POOLE	Well it's nothing really important but it's annoying.
L3964	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Sure what is it?
L3963	u60	m3	POOLE	Dave if you've a minute I'd like your advice on something.
L3945	u60	m3	POOLE	Okay come on down.
L3944	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay. 
L3943	u60	m3	POOLE	Right. Just a sec.
L3942	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hi. Frank... coming in please.
L4368	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Listen to me very carefully Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
L4367	u56	m3	HAL	I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now Dave but it would be a crying shame since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
L4366	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I am prepared to do that anyway.
L4363	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal unless you follow my instructions I shall be forced to disconnect you.
L4362	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry Dave but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4 quote When the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote. I must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
L4361	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
L4360	u56	m3	HAL	I can tell from the tone of your voice Dave that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
L4357	u56	m3	HAL	I don't like to assert myself Dave but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
L4356	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal switch to manual hibernation control.
L4355	u56	m3	HAL	Look Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
L4354	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm goin to do this myself Hal. Let me have the control please.
L4353	u56	m3	HAL	If you're determined to revive the crew now I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
L4350	u56	m3	HAL	I don't really agree with you Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
L4349	u50	m3	BOWMAN	It doesn't have to be Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control please.
L4348	u56	m3	HAL	Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
L4347	u50	m3	BOWMAN	The antenna has to be replaced.
L4346	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
L4335	u56	m3	HAL	I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
L4334	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes it is.
L4333	u56	m3	HAL	Too bad about Frank isn't it?
L4271	u56	m3	HAL	Well that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
L4270	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes it is Hal.
L4269	u56	m3	HAL	Is your confidence in me fully restored?
L4268	u50	m3	BOWMAN	And don't you worry about it.
L4267	u56	m3	HAL	Well don't worry about it.
L4266	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I'm sorry about the misunderstanding Hal.
L4265	u56	m3	HAL	Naturally Dave I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected even temporarily as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
L4230	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Okay Hal well let's see the way things go from here on.
L4229	u56	m3	HAL	Look Dave I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job and that you're trying to be helpful but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units and with your test gear.
L4228	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Hal is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
L4227	u56	m3	HAL	I'm not questioning your word Dave but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
L4224	u56	m3	HAL	Yes I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
L4223	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You probably also know that we found them okay.
L4222	u56	m3	HAL	Yes I know.
L4221	u50	m3	BOWMAN	You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
L4220	u56	m3	HAL	Sure Dave what's up?
L4219	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Not now Hal I'd like to talk to you about something.
L4080	u50	m3	BOWMAN	I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please let me have the hard copy.
L4079	u56	m3	HAL	The unit is still operational Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
L4070	u56	m3	HAL	MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
L4069	u50	m3	BOWMAN	What is it Hal?
L4068	u56	m3	HAL	Sorry to interrupt the festivities Dave but I think we've got a problem.
L4007	u50	m3	BOWMAN	He's got a point.
L4006	u56	m3	HAL	I'm sorry Frank but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
L4019	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and... why are we going?
L4018	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4010	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Still you really don't believe it do you?
L4009	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L4003	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well... it's silly but... if you want to why don't you?
L4002	u51	m3	C12	CONINUED
L3994	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Well what is it?
L3993	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3978	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Did they have any explanation for this?
L3977	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3971	u50	m3	BOWMAN	Yes I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
L3970	u51	m3	C12	CONTINUED
L3693	u52	m3	CHILD	Goodbye Daddy.
L3692	u55	m3	FLOYD	'Bye 'bye now sweetheart.
L3691	u52	m3	CHILD	Yes Daddy.
L3690	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right Darling?
L3689	u52	m3	CHILD	Thank you Daddy.
L3688	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
L3685	u55	m3	FLOYD	Three darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
L3684	u52	m3	CHILD	How many days until you come home?
L3683	u55	m3	FLOYD	Okay sweetheart. Well I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
L3682	u52	m3	CHILD	She's in the bathroom.
L3681	u55	m3	FLOYD	Where is Mrs. Brown?
L3680	u52	m3	CHILD	Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
L3679	u55	m3	FLOYD	One two three. Can I speak to Mommy?
L3677	u55	m3	FLOYD	In three days darling I hope.
L3676	u52	m3	CHILD	When are you coming home?
L3675	u55	m3	FLOYD	No I'm sorry darling I told you I won't be home for a few days.
L3674	u52	m3	CHILD	Are you coming to my party?
L3673	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes I know that sweetheart.
L3672	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm having a party tomorrow.
L3669	u52	m3	CHILD	I'm fine Daddy. When are you coming home?
L3668	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm at Space Station Five darling. How are you?
L3810	u59	m3	PILOT	I'll bet it's a fortune.
L3809	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	I was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
L3808	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes well whatever it is they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
L3807	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
L3806	u59	m3	PILOT	I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
L3805	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Well I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
L3799	u59	m3	PILOT	Well how's it going back there?
L3798	u53	m3	CO-PILOT	Thank you.
L3797	u59	m3	PILOT	Oh thank you very much.
L3780	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
L3779	u54	m3	ELENA	Well Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
L3776	u54	m3	ELENA	Well I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
L3775	u55	m3	FLOYD	No thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
L3774	u54	m3	ELENA	Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
L3759	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well that does sound very odd.
L3758	u54	m3	ELENA	Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
L3735	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well where are all of you off to?
L3734	u54	m3	ELENA	He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
L3733	u55	m3	FLOYD	How is gregor?
L3732	u54	m3	ELENA	Oh that's such a delightful age.
L3731	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact she's six tomorrow.
L3730	u54	m3	ELENA	And your charming little daughter?
L3653	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes it's coming along very well.
L3652	u58	m3	MILLER	I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
L3651	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes I think so. Just about then.
L3631	u55	m3	FLOYD	Fine.
L3630	u58	m3	MILLER	Well shall we go through Documentation?
L3629	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes very pleasant.
L3628	u58	m3	MILLER	Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
L3627	u55	m3	FLOYD	Please it really doesn't matter.
L3626	u58	m3	MILLER	Well thank you very much for being so understanding.
L3623	u58	m3	MILLER	I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time and I was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang.
L3622	u55	m3	FLOYD	How do you do Mr. Miller?
L3773	u55	m3	FLOYD	Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
L3772	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	This epidemic could easily spread to our base Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
L3768	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something apperently of an unknown origin. Is this in fact what has happened?
L3767	u55	m3	FLOYD	Certainly.
L3766	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Dr. Floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may I ask you a straightforward question?
L3763	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well I'm glad about that.
L3762	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Fortunately they did.
L3761	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes... Well I hope the crew got back safely.
L3760	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
L3754	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3753	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	That's right.
L3752	u55	m3	FLOYD	You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
L3751	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but it's been going on for the past ten days.
L3748	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Yes. Well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
L3747	u55	m3	FLOYD	Really?
L3746	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Well it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
L3745	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm sorry but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
L3740	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yesas a matter of fact I am.
L3739	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you by any chance going up to your base at Clavius?
L3738	u55	m3	FLOYD	Well as it happens I'm on my way up to the moon
L3726	u55	m3	FLOYD	Yes really thank you very much.
L3725	u61	m3	SMYSLOV	Are you quite sure?
L3724	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
L3907	u57	m3	MICHAELS	I don't think it has but I'd like to check that. Simpson what's the log on that?
L3906	u55	m3	FLOYD	Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
L3905	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Well not really. At first glance black would suggest something sun-powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
L3904	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any ideas about the colour?
L3897	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Tomb shine survey-marker spare part take your choice.
L3896	u55	m3	FLOYD	But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
L3893	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
L3892	u55	m3	FLOYD	Any clue as to what it is?
L3891	u57	m3	MICHAELS	By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
L3890	u55	m3	FLOYD	How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
L3889	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Yes it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
L3869	u55	m3	FLOYD	I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
L3868	u57	m3	MICHAELS	Dr. Floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
L3839	u59	m3	PILOT	Well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
L3838	u55	m3	FLOYD	No of course Captain I can understand your concern.
L3837	u59	m3	PILOT	Well fine. Thanks very much anyway and I hope you don't mind me asking?
L3834	u59	m3	PILOT	Yes well I wouldn't have been too concerned about it except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact I've heard that ten people have died already.
L3833	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see. Well I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
L3832	u59	m3	PILOT	Well I'll tell you why I ask. You see I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears I'm a little concerned about her.
L3829	u59	m3	PILOT	I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
L3828	u55	m3	FLOYD	I see.
L3827	u59	m3	PILOT	Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
L3826	u55	m3	FLOYD	What do you mean?
L3825	u59	m3	PILOT	Incidentally Dr. Floyd I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
L3824	u55	m3	FLOYD	Thank you.
L3821	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh no thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
L3820	u59	m3	PILOT	We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
L3819	u55	m3	FLOYD	When do we arrive at Clavius?
L3818	u59	m3	PILOT	There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
L3817	u55	m3	FLOYD	Oh marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
L4183	u60	m3	POOLE	All right Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy please.
L4182	u56	m3	HAL	Not really Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.

L4923	u63	m4	BARTENDER	Look give me a break you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
L4922	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I don't give a damn about his girl...
L4906	u63	m4	BARTENDER	I don't give a shit who you ask.
L4905	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Maybe I better ask around see what your pals think.
L4904	u63	m4	BARTENDER	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
L4903	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Now how's your memory doin'?

L4511	u69	m4	GANZ	Just do what I say okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
L4510	u64	m4	BILLY	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
L4509	u69	m4	GANZ	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
L4508	u64	m4	BILLY	I never paid for it in my life.
L4507	u69	m4	GANZ	Yeah dummy.  Money.
L4506	u64	m4	BILLY	Pay money?
L4505	u69	m4	GANZ	Pros.
L4504	u64	m4	BILLY	Whaddya mean buy?

L4502	u64	m4	BILLY	I ain't tired yet.
L4501	u69	m4	GANZ	I want to drive awhile.
L4454	u64	m4	BILLY	You got a real big mouth convict.
L4453	u69	m4	GANZ	Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck Tonto.
L5371	u65	m4	CANDY	Now you're talkin'. See ya...

L5367	u65	m4	CANDY	Hey don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro remember?
L5366	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Here you go baby.
L5216	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact I think we can have a party.
L5215	u65	m4	CANDY	Hello again.
L5194	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Here's hoping baby...
L5193	u65	m4	CANDY	Well maybe I'll see you later ...
L5188	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
L5187	u65	m4	CANDY	What's the matter with my place?
L5186	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No baby nothin' like that. Look there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
L5185	u65	m4	CANDY	You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
L5184	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah i been waiting three years.
L5183	u65	m4	CANDY	You're in a hurry.
L5182	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Here you go sweetheart throw it my way.
L5181	u65	m4	CANDY	Hey don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
L5180	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Goodbye.
L5179	u65	m4	CANDY	No I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
L5178	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
L5177	u65	m4	CANDY	Hey what kind of talk is that?
L5176	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Excuse me baby but if i don't get some action tonight I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
L5175	u65	m4	CANDY	I'm candy...
L5329	u66	m4	CASEY	In the back.  Down the other corridor.
L5328	u67	m4	CATES	Where's ganz?
L5325	u67	m4	CATES	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise he gets ventilated.
L5324	u66	m4	CASEY	No chance.
L5323	u67	m4	CATES	You're gonna help us take him.
L5322	u66	m4	CASEY	Yeah.  Sure i'm crazy in love with him who wouldn't be...
L5321	u67	m4	CATES	You and the other one you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
L5318	u67	m4	CATES	No time for any of that crap any more lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
L5317	u66	m4	CASEY	Would you guys...
L5316	u67	m4	CATES	I hear you've got visitors.
L4960	u66	m4	CASEY	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
L4959	u67	m4	CATES	How about it?
L4945	u66	m4	CASEY	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
L4944	u67	m4	CATES	I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
L5348	u69	m4	GANZ	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
L5347	u67	m4	CATES	You're done.  End of story.
L5346	u69	m4	GANZ	I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
L5340	u69	m4	GANZ	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
L5339	u67	m4	CATES	I don't think you're gonna make it.
L5338	u69	m4	GANZ	After I get outta this cop...I'm gonna live forever...
L4629	u69	m4	GANZ	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
L4628	u67	m4	CATES	You lying son of a bitch...
L5384	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No trouble Jack. But listen suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
L5383	u67	m4	CATES	Thanks.
L5382	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
L5381	u67	m4	CATES	No you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
L5380	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
L5379	u67	m4	CATES	That's right. Not my style Reggie..
L5378	u71	m4	HAMMOND	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
L5377	u67	m4	CATES	It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
L5376	u67	m4	CATES	There's nothin' to talk about.
L5375	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Wait a minute Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
L5373	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey Jack real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
L5372	u67	m4	CATES	Okay reggie start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
L5353	u67	m4	CATES	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
L5352	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
L5351	u67	m4	CATES	You okay?
L5314	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Well you got to admit we come a long way.
L5313	u67	m4	CATES	Partnership?
L5312	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
L5311	u67	m4	CATES	Sure I'll give you a shot at it but Ganz is mine.  You know that big Indian plays it for keeps...
L5310	u71	m4	HAMMOND	If we run into Billy first let me try and talk him in.
L5309	u67	m4	CATES	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
L5308	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey there she is...
L5307	u67	m4	CATES	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything I'm gonna know it.
L5306	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
L5305	u67	m4	CATES	If she's right and if you don't screw up.
L5304	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Do I get to kiss her too?
L5291	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together hardly any clothes one watching TV...
L5290	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
L5257	u67	m4	CATES	Don't worry about it.
L5256	u71	m4	HAMMOND	It's late they're closing...
L5255	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah but we didn't get 'em.
L5254	u67	m4	CATES	Naw you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
L5253	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Sorry we didn't do better Jack. I feel like I let you down.
L5252	u67	m4	CATES	I don't know about you but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
L5251	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
L5250	u67	m4	CATES	I had it impounded.  Come on we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
L5249	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey how'd my car get here?
L5237	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
L5236	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Notice something funny about that bus?
L5227	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Luther's on the move...
L5226	u67	m4	CATES	Why?
L5225	u71	m4	HAMMOND	When you been in prison three years it don't take long. Let's go.
L5224	u67	m4	CATES	That was quick.
L5213	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
L5212	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah I see her.
L5210	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah. Guess not.
L5209	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything Jack ...
L5208	u67	m4	CATES	Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya doin' my job.
L5207	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You sure that's the reason?
L5206	u67	m4	CATES	I don't know why but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
L5205	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
L5204	u67	m4	CATES	Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
L5202	u67	m4	CATES	So you took the rest of the night off...
"L5201	u71	m4	HAMMOND	They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."
L5200	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
L5199	u67	m4	CATES	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
L5198	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
L5197	u67	m4	CATES	We missed.
L5196	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What about Ganz?
L5195	u67	m4	CATES	What about Luther?
L5192	u67	m4	CATES	Hello. And goodbye.
L5191	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
L5190	u67	m4	CATES	Where's luther?
L5172	u67	m4	CATES	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass right?
L5171	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey Jack how ya doin'? What took you so long to call man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
L5085	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No way...
L5084	u67	m4	CATES	You stay with me...
L5083	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
L5077	u67	m4	CATES	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then you're all set.
L5076	u71	m4	HAMMOND	That was in style a couple years back man.
L5074	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
L5073	u71	m4	HAMMOND	We're getting too close ... Cates what's the matter you been takin' dumb pills?
L5072	u67	m4	CATES	Class isn't somethin' you buy punk. Look at you five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
L5071	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No class...
L5070	u67	m4	CATES	What you don't understand is I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
L5069	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You know I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
L5068	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
L5067	u71	m4	HAMMOND	A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
L5066	u71	m4	HAMMOND	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is which would be amazin' cause I already think he's real dumb.
L5065	u67	m4	CATES	Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
L5064	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You got a very depressing view of life man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
L5063	u67	m4	CATES	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
L5062	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
L5061	u67	m4	CATES	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
L5060	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Say do you always work people over like you did Luther?
L5059	u67	m4	CATES	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
L5058	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
L5057	u67	m4	CATES	I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
L5056	u67	m4	CATES	Oh yeah does bein' in love make you stupid?
L5055	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
L5054	u67	m4	CATES	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass I'd  just leave town.
L5053	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Tryin' to save his girl man. He's in another world.
L5052	u67	m4	CATES	You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
L5051	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
L5050	u67	m4	CATES	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
L5049	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Jesus Christ look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
L5038	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
L5037	u67	m4	CATES	Musta got some primo bondsman.
L5036	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What?
L5035	u67	m4	CATES	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
L5034	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
L5033	u67	m4	CATES	You took a big chance leaving this here all this time.
L5030	u67	m4	CATES	Shit.
L5029	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice Jack.
L5028	u67	m4	CATES	You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
L5025	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You just drove by it.
L5024	u67	m4	CATES	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
L5023	u71	m4	HAMMOND	This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
L5022	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You're a real case you know that Jack?
L5021	u67	m4	CATES	Where's the goddamn car?
L5020	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah.  Right.
L5019	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L5018	u67	m4	CATES	Right partner.
L5017	u71	m4	HAMMOND	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress right?
L5016	u67	m4	CATES	Where's the money?
L5014	u67	m4	CATES	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
L5013	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You gonna let me keep any of it?
L5012	u67	m4	CATES	Not likely convict.
L5011	u71	m4	HAMMOND	We split 50-50?
L5010	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You catch on real fast...Okay Jack let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
L5009	u67	m4	CATES	He's after your money.
L5008	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty livin' in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
L5007	u67	m4	CATES	Just tell me about the money.
L5005	u67	m4	CATES	Jesus.
L5004	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Half a million.
L5003	u67	m4	CATES	How much?
L5002	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I been waiting a long time for some money.
L4997	u71	m4	HAMMOND	One thing's for sure Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
L4996	u67	m4	CATES	They saved your ass convict.
L4995	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Naw you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
L4994	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah right.  You want to try again?
L4975	u67	m4	CATES	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
L4974	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
L4973	u67	m4	CATES	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
L4972	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I'm impressed with you too Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
L4971	u67	m4	CATES	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far what I got outta you is nothin'...
L4970	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You wanna leave man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
L4969	u67	m4	CATES	This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So instead of me being where I oughta be which is in bed giving my girl the high hard one I'm out here doing this shit roaming around with some overdressed charcoal-colored loser like you.
L4965	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
L4964	u67	m4	CATES	Let's go.
L4939	u67	m4	CATES	Come on.
L4938	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Must be billy's girl.
L4937	u67	m4	CATES	There.
L4930	u67	m4	CATES	While you're at it You can give me the switchblade too.
L4929	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You made that move huh?
L4912	u67	m4	CATES	Some of us citizens are with you all the way Officer.
L4911	u71	m4	HAMMOND	That wasn't necessary buddy. I got this under control.
L4896	u67	m4	CATES	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
L4895	u71	m4	HAMMOND	This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
L4894	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
L4893	u67	m4	CATES	I'm gonna enjoy this ... here I'll even loan you my badge.
L4891	u67	m4	CATES	The bet's off.
L4890	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
L4889	u67	m4	CATES	You tell me what Ganz busted out for he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is you're part of it.
L4888	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?
L4887	u67	m4	CATES	I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
L4886	u71	m4	HAMMOND	That's never been one of my problems.
L4885	u67	m4	CATES	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
L4884	u71	m4	HAMMOND	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number or a dead Indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
L4883	u67	m4	CATES	I got two problems.  Number one I'm not playin' games.  Number two you got nothin' to bet with.
L4882	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey you wanna bet?
L4881	u67	m4	CATES	You need five years training to handle a joint like...
L4880	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
L4879	u67	m4	CATES	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
L4878	u71	m4	HAMMOND	But you can handle it all right huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
L4877	u67	m4	CATES	If they kick my ass they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
L4876	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
L4875	u67	m4	CATES	This part of town they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
L4874	u71	m4	HAMMOND	It's a long shot but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
L4873	u67	m4	CATES	Well?
L4871	u71	m4	HAMMOND	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
L4870	u67	m4	CATES	Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
L4869	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You have a good time?
L4868	u67	m4	CATES	Last night.
L4867	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Last night two nights ago three?

L4864	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
L4863	u67	m4	CATES	Now where we goin' convict?
L4861	u67	m4	CATES	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway what the fuck do you care?
L4860	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You really do have onoe huh Jack... what's her problem besides you?
L4858	u67	m4	CATES	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
L4857	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
L4855	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah I want mandolins flowers... They move off down the corridor.
L4854	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
L4853	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people nice music...
L4852	u67	m4	CATES	We eat when I say we eat.
L4851	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
"L4850	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah well my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
L4849	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
L4848	u67	m4	CATES	We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
L4828	u71	m4	HAMMOND	If you let him run around till Tuesday he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you motherfucker?
L4827	u67	m4	CATES	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
L4826	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I think you better put him on ice man.
L4825	u67	m4	CATES	What do you think?
L4816	u67	m4	CATES	Want to try it again?
L4815	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Thank you.
L4814	u67	m4	CATES	Hey this works pretty good.
L4803	u67	m4	CATES	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
L4802	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
L4801	u67	m4	CATES	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
L4800	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff Jack I need to talk to this man.
L4792	u67	m4	CATES	I'm helpin' you huh?
L4791	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
L4790	u67	m4	CATES	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
L4789	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Just up the street the other side over there ... Now don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
L4788	u67	m4	CATES	I may call you worse than that.
L4787	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
L4786	u67	m4	CATES	I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
L4785	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Just an expression man don't mean nothin'.
L4784	u67	m4	CATES	I can read a police file shithead and quit calling me Jack.
L4783	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What gang you talkin' about Jack?
L4782	u67	m4	CATES	Luther was part of the gang?
L4781	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Don't worry I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
L4780	u67	m4	CATES	Okay let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
L4779	u71	m4	HAMMOND	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
L4778	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah.
L4775	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Shit.  I'm already sorry.
L4774	u67	m4	CATES	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L4773	u71	m4	HAMMOND	No way to start a partnership.
L4772	u67	m4	CATES	You just don't get it do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
L4771	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
L4770	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
L4769	u67	m4	CATES	I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
L4766	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Listen it may be a little out of date. You know I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
L4765	u67	m4	CATES	We're supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers...
L4764	u71	m4	HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
L4763	u67	m4	CATES	This prison gives out $400 suits?
L4751	u67	m4	CATES	I'll think about it.
L4750	u71	m4	HAMMOND	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
L4749	u67	m4	CATES	Bullshit.
L4748	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I got a lot to protect.
L4747	u67	m4	CATES	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
L4746	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I can help you man but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
L4745	u67	m4	CATES	You're crazy.
L4744	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
L4743	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah?
L4741	u67	m4	CATES	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
L4740	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
L4739	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah I noticed...
L4732	u67	m4	CATES	Not likely Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
L4731	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You here to write my life story?
L4729	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Sure anything you want.
L4728	u67	m4	CATES	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private okay?
L4727	u71	m4	HAMMOND	You got a name cop?
L5245	u67	m4	CATES	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
L5244	u70	m4	HADEN	Where the Christ do you think you're going?
L5243	u70	m4	HADEN	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip huh?.
L5242	u67	m4	CATES	He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
L5104	u70	m4	HADEN	Too bad it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
L5103	u67	m4	CATES	I didn't have the time.
L5102	u70	m4	HADEN	Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
L5101	u67	m4	CATES	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
L5100	u70	m4	HADEN	What a screw-up.
L5099	u70	m4	HADEN	You couldn't get to him?
L5098	u67	m4	CATES	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
L5097	u70	m4	HADEN	Which one pulled the trigger?
L5096	u67	m4	CATES	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
L5095	u70	m4	HADEN	How did they get away?
L5094	u67	m4	CATES	I lost them that's what happened.
L5093	u70	m4	HADEN	What the bell happened?
L4703	u67	m4	CATES	I'll keep it in mind.
L4702	u70	m4	HADEN	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
L4701	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah?
L4700	u70	m4	HADEN	Jack?
L4699	u67	m4	CATES	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
L4698	u70	m4	HADEN	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up I can promise you you're goin' down.
L4697	u67	m4	CATES	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides I got a lead...
L4696	u70	m4	HADEN	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one Jack.
L4695	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
L4694	u70	m4	HADEN	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
L4693	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah...
L4692	u70	m4	HADEN	Jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know we all know the truth's a little different.
L4691	u67	m4	CATES	Hey the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
L4690	u70	m4	HADEN	Yeah I read the report...
L4689	u67	m4	CATES	I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
L4644	u77	m4	YOUNG COP	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
L4643	u67	m4	CATES	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor don't give me a bunch of crap.
L4642	u77	m4	YOUNG COP	Somebody steals your gun you're supposed to file a report.
L4639	u67	m4	CATES	The truth hurts doesn't it buddy?
L4638	u77	m4	YOUNG COP	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
L4637	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah.
L4636	u77	m4	YOUNG COP	That's what you say Cates...
L5163	u73	m4	KEHOE	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
L5162	u67	m4	CATES	Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
L5159	u67	m4	CATES	What?
L5158	u73	m4	KEHOE	I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
L5145	u73	m4	KEHOE	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know you ought to get some rest...
L5144	u67	m4	CATES	I got to wait for a call.
L5143	u73	m4	KEHOE	I'm heading out. How about you?
L5142	u67	m4	CATES	Bullshit red tape.
L5138	u73	m4	KEHOE	Nothing.
L5137	u67	m4	CATES	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
L5136	u73	m4	KEHOE	Doesn't look like it.
L5135	u67	m4	CATES	Aw bullshit you heard wrong.
L5134	u73	m4	KEHOE	Long night too from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman some jig beat the crap out of you.
L5133	u67	m4	CATES	So do you...been a long day.
L5132	u73	m4	KEHOE	You look awful.
L4687	u67	m4	CATES	One of  em's in the slam.
L4686	u73	m4	KEHOE	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
L4685	u67	m4	CATES	I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
L4682	u73	m4	KEHOE	Hey ... Dick Tracy.
L4681	u67	m4	CATES	Tell me that's not the same guy.
L4680	u73	m4	KEHOE	Uhh ... Wong Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
L4679	u67	m4	CATES	Wait a minute wait a minute... who's this?
L4678	u73	m4	KEHOE	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
L4677	u67	m4	CATES	Who are all these?
L4676	u73	m4	KEHOE	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
L4675	u67	m4	CATES	Billy Bear...
L4673	u67	m4	CATES	Shit.
L4672	u73	m4	KEHOE	This guy must have had a .44 like yours Jack. Now he's got yours.
L4671	u67	m4	CATES	I'll help you out.
L4670	u73	m4	KEHOE	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
L4669	u67	m4	CATES	Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
L4823	u75	m4	LUTHER	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
L4822	u67	m4	CATES	When? How?
L4821	u75	m4	LUTHER	He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
L4819	u75	m4	LUTHER	I don't know.
L4818	u67	m4	CATES	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know like where they stashed her.
L4817	u75	m4	LUTHER	Ganz and Billy got my girl Rosalie.
L4813	u75	m4	LUTHER	Who gives a fuck what you think?
L4812	u67	m4	CATES	You just took a shot at me asshole. I think you do know where he is.
L4811	u75	m4	LUTHER	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
L4810	u67	m4	CATES	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
L4809	u75	m4	LUTHER	A cop...
L5365	u67	m4	CATES	That's what I always say.
L5364	u68	m4	ELAINE	You're impossible...
L5363	u67	m4	CATES	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
L5362	u68	m4	ELAINE	Tell me.
L5361	u67	m4	CATES	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah never mind...
L5360	u68	m4	ELAINE	Where is he?
L5359	u67	m4	CATES	Three more hours...
L5358	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag but it works.
L5357	u68	m4	ELAINE	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
L5356	u67	m4	CATES	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin' shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
L5355	u68	m4	ELAINE	How'd they take it back at headquarters?
L5303	u67	m4	CATES	Let's go Reggie.
L5302	u68	m4	ELAINE	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
L5301	u67	m4	CATES	Whaddya think?
L5298	u68	m4	ELAINE	Oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out.
L5297	u67	m4	CATES	Hey Come on shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
L5296	u68	m4	ELAINE	When a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible.
L5295	u67	m4	CATES	So what?
L5294	u68	m4	ELAINE	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week Jack and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
L5293	u67	m4	CATES	Come on they were a little old for a slumber party.
L5292	u68	m4	ELAINE	What makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes?
L5287	u68	m4	ELAINE	Jack it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
L5286	u67	m4	CATES	How do you know?
L5285	u68	m4	ELAINE	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
L5284	u67	m4	CATES	Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
L5276	u67	m4	CATES	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz no Indian.
L5275	u68	m4	ELAINE	You real down?
L5263	u67	m4	CATES	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
L5262	u68	m4	ELAINE	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so but you look like shit.  What happened?
L5261	u67	m4	CATES	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
L5260	u68	m4	ELAINE	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
L5259	u67	m4	CATES	Hiya kid.
L5258	u68	m4	ELAINE	Hey I don't believe it.
L5221	u68	m4	ELAINE	Fuck you.
L5220	u67	m4	CATES	Hi it's me...
L5219	u68	m4	ELAINE	Hello.
L5169	u67	m4	CATES	Just a second that's all!
L5168	u68	m4	ELAINE	Jack wait...
L5167	u67	m4	CATES	Elaine I gotta put you on hold...
L5165	u68	m4	ELAINE	Jack?  What was that?
L5164	u67	m4	CATES	The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
L5153	u68	m4	ELAINE	So am I.
L5152	u67	m4	CATES	No it's I'm just surprised you called.
L5151	u68	m4	ELAINE	No wonder you're so popular.
L5150	u67	m4	CATES	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
L5149	u68	m4	ELAINE	I'm at work asshole.  Where else?
L4840	u68	m4	ELAINE	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
L4839	u67	m4	CATES	Listen Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things okay?
L4837	u67	m4	CATES	Elaine look I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
L4836	u68	m4	ELAINE	Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
L4718	u68	m4	ELAINE	I get that. The job first. Everything else especially me second. I get it. I don't like it.
L4717	u67	m4	CATES	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
L4716	u68	m4	ELAINE	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
L4715	u67	m4	CATES	I didn't get burned two cops did. Listen I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
L4714	u68	m4	ELAINE	Look Jack if you make everything your personal responsibility you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
L4713	u67	m4	CATES	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people my gun is ...
L4712	u68	m4	ELAINE	Look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
L4709	u67	m4	CATES	Sure okay fine no problem... See there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
L4708	u68	m4	ELAINE	Jack are you okay?
L4707	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah Guess it must have been a slow news day...
L4706	u68	m4	ELAINE	You made the front page.
L4705	u67	m4	CATES	Yeah one of my favorites.
L4704	u68	m4	ELAINE	Great place for lunch.
L4535	u67	m4	CATES	Guess people ought to know who I am...
L4534	u68	m4	ELAINE	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
L4533	u67	m4	CATES	Thanks for the coffee.
L4532	u68	m4	ELAINE	Yeah for some reason I'm sure...
L4531	u67	m4	CATES	You sure you want me to?
L4530	u68	m4	ELAINE	Call me later.
L4529	u67	m4	CATES	That's the way I see it too.
L4528	u68	m4	ELAINE	You know something Jack you really are hopeless.
L4525	u68	m4	ELAINE	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
L4524	u67	m4	CATES	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
L4523	u68	m4	ELAINE	When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
L4522	u67	m4	CATES	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
L4521	u68	m4	ELAINE	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
L4520	u67	m4	CATES	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
L4519	u68	m4	ELAINE	That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
L4517	u68	m4	ELAINE	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
L4516	u67	m4	CATES	Maybe you ought to buy me one.
L4514	u67	m4	CATES	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
L4513	u68	m4	ELAINE	You know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
L4488	u67	m4	CATES	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
L4487	u68	m4	ELAINE	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
L4486	u67	m4	CATES	Hey you know what I really think?
L4485	u68	m4	ELAINE	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems I'll take brutal indifference.
L4484	u67	m4	CATES	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
L4483	u68	m4	ELAINE	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
L4482	u67	m4	CATES	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
L4481	u68	m4	ELAINE	Then I sit back and I think I mean who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
L4480	u67	m4	CATES	I guess he got the message...
L4479	u68	m4	ELAINE	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
L4478	u67	m4	CATES	What'd you do?
L4477	u68	m4	ELAINE	A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
L4476	u67	m4	CATES	What's wrong with that?
L4475	u68	m4	ELAINE	I'm all wet.
L4474	u67	m4	CATES	That's the way I see it too.
L4473	u68	m4	ELAINE	You're hopeless.
L4472	u67	m4	CATES	Hey you're right.
L4471	u68	m4	ELAINE	I still don't think it's loaded.
L4470	u67	m4	CATES	This is a .44 Magnum the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
L4469	u68	m4	ELAINE	I don't think your gun's loaded...
L4468	u67	m4	CATES	I don't answer questions I ask 'em...
L4467	u68	m4	ELAINE	What am I wanted for?
L5289	u68	m4	ELAINE	In all due respect he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
L5288	u71	m4	HAMMOND	He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal went all the way for you...
L5282	u68	m4	ELAINE	That's no bull.
L5281	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hey two days with him is enough.
L5280	u68	m4	ELAINE	How would you know?
L5279	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Hard man to live with.
L5268	u68	m4	ELAINE	Shrink major not a shrink.
L5267	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Well I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink wearin' that dress...
L5266	u68	m4	ELAINE	I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
L5265	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Name's Hammond Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
L5264	u68	m4	ELAINE	Who the hell are you?
L4613	u74	m4	LISA	Alright I'm coming...hold on.
L4612	u69	m4	GANZ	Keep stallin'.
L4610	u74	m4	LISA	What do you want?
L4609	u69	m4	GANZ	Stall.
L4604	u69	m4	GANZ	Shut up.
L4603	u74	m4	LISA	What do you want?  What's goin' on?
L4602	u74	m4	LISA	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
L4601	u69	m4	GANZ	Shut up.
L4600	u74	m4	LISA	Hey...

L4496	u72	m4	HENRY	Can't complain.
L4495	u69	m4	GANZ	How ya doin'?
L4494	u72	m4	HENRY	Hot?  Hey they're not even room temperature.
L4493	u69	m4	GANZ	How hot are they?
L5234	u69	m4	GANZ	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
L5233	u75	m4	LUTHER	Rosalie you okay?
L5231	u69	m4	GANZ	First the money.
L5230	u75	m4	LUTHER	Let her go.
L4559	u69	m4	GANZ	You try to mess with us or go to the cops I promise you I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
L4558	u75	m4	LUTHER	Come on you can trust me. Please.
L4555	u75	m4	LUTHER	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning that's when it opens. After that I'll get the money to you right away...

L4550	u69	m4	GANZ	Billy go ahead break it...
L4549	u75	m4	LUTHER	Don't give me this we were partners.
L4548	u69	m4	GANZ	Instead of worryin' about Reggie you better worry about me...
L4547	u69	m4	GANZ	You want that Indian to snap her neck?
L4546	u75	m4	LUTHER	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
L4545	u69	m4	GANZ	I want the money asshole what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
L4544	u75	m4	LUTHER	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
L4543	u69	m4	GANZ	Surprise Luther.
L5125	u71	m4	HAMMOND	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
L5124	u76	m4	SOSNA	Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
L5123	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Try and take it.
L5122	u76	m4	SOSNA	Give it back.
L5121	u71	m4	HAMMOND	Yeah I know that but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
L5120	u76	m4	SOSNA	This ain't a credit business.
