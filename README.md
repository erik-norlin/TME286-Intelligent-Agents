# TME286-Intelligent-Agents
Course TME286 at Chalmers University. The focus here has been to implement interpretable natural language processing (NLP) models such as n-gram language models, n-gram auto-completion, Bayesian text classification, information retrieval chatbots. Then comparing these models to deep learning models to show that interpretable machine learning models can perform just as good as deep learning models. Also discussing ethics regarding AI.
